Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

Key to this are World Cores - found hidden at the bottom of each chunk. World Cores can also be used to build a World Forge, which provides the ability to refine raw dirt and stone into more World Cores.\n\nThere are two options for how the generated - missing chunks are either empty (making a skyworld), or are replaced with bedrock (sealing them).\n\nIn Forge and Fabric you can now configure Chunk By Chunk from the main menu, using the Mods... menu prior to creating a world to configure the settings for that world. For fabric this requires the Mod Menu mod. For Quilt this is not available yet.

Maintained and kept up to date for modern versions of Minecraft and fully compatible with multiplayer!\n\nThe Aether centers around a dimension high in the sky, filled with **vast skylands** of clouds and **floating islands**. This dimension features its own new survival adventure, based around a basic vanilla-esque **survival progression** that features **new ores**, **mythical mobs**, and **three perilous dungeons** each with their own **powerful loot items**.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image0.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ What's in the Mod ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether consists of many new accessible features, most of which are explained in the original forum post for the [Aether Collaboration Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275355-1-7-3-aether-collaboration-mod-v1-02-new-mobs). A brief overview of this content includes:\n* A Hostile Paradise in the sky: the Aether dimension! Just make sure not to fall off of it, or you’ll end up back in the Overworld.\n* A range of new blocks and items accessible from the dimension itself.\n* 3 utility blocks: The Altar, Freezer, and Incubator.\n* 4 material tiers: Skyroot, Holystone, Zanite, and Gravitite, each with their own tools and weapons with unique abilities.\n* The Book of Lore, complete with an entry for every block and item in the mod.\n* An accessory system that lets you utilize the loot you discover.\n* Mobs both reminiscent of the Overworld and unique to the Aether.\n* Moas: a flying mob mount with different tiers of differing jump counts.\n* 3 new structures to conquer: the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Dungeons, each with their own equipment to loot and bosses to defeat.\n* Eternal Day, only able to be ended once the final dungeon is conquered, then the day cycle can be controlled with a unique utility block: the Sun Altar.\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Getting Started ☁️</center></h2>\n\nTo get started with the Aether, you must construct a portal with a **Glowstone frame** and light it with a **water bucket** in the middle, this will activate the portal and allow you to step through and enter the dimension. From here you can begin your survival in the Aether’s hostile paradise!\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image1.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Conquering Dungeons ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether's world contains three new mysterious dungeons, each with a fearsome boss to defeat...\n\nThe **Bronze Dungeon** is the home of the Sentries and guarded by the ominous **Slider**, a creature born of pure stone. Look out for hidden tunnels through islands and prepare yourself with the best gear you can craft!\n\nThe **Silver Dungeon** is the beautiful Valkyrie Temple. Challenge the knights of the Valkyrie Order and, if you prove worthy, fight the **Valkyrie Queen** herself. Utilize every tool and trick you can to best this ancient warrior. \n\nWithin the rare **Gold Dungeon** lies the **Sun Spirit**, an eternal being of pure fire and energy. He is the God that rules the very Sun itself and will take some convincing to even pay attention to a being such as yourself. But it is rumored he guards some of the best treasure that exists in the Aether.  \n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image2.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Join the Conversation ☁️</center></h2>\n\nCome join our Discord server to chat with a growing community of over 10,000 members!\n\nHave a question for the developers?

Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version!

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

a low performance cost. Please check the \"Gallery\" section to see some screenshots showcasing the shader's visual style and general look.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Unique Technologies**\n\nSolas is one of the first shaderpacks to achieve the goal of super fast per-block colored lighting and light bouncing in Minecraft. Both are done by blurring the texture of the block, doing some calculations and applying that color to the scene with.\n\nMost other shaderpacks with 3D volumetric clouds have a problem of them leaking into closed spaces like caves or mountains. Solas fixes that problem by toggling a cloud shadow check in cases when a closed space is detected, thus essentially turning volumetric clouds into volumetric light.\n\nAnother problem a lot of shaderpacks have is shadow light leaking and peter panning which is not minimized in Solas.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Key Features**\n+ 3D volumetric clouds and light rays.\n+ Volumetric Nether and End fog.\n+ Water, atmospheric and border fog.\n+ Fast colored lighting and global illumination.\n+ Fancy sky effects: aurora borealis, Milky Way, ender nebula, ender vortex and more.\n+ Cinematic post effects: bloom, chromatic aberration, depth of field, image sharpening, adjustable and flexible tonemap, TAA, FXAA.\n+ Integrated PBR resourcepack with generated emissives, specular and normals.\n+ Support for PBR respurcepacks.\n+ Advanced lighting model: vanilla & custom ambient occlusion, variable penumbra shadows.\n+ Many customizable options with their proper translations to English, Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish languages.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Support my work on Boosty!**\n\nhttps://boosty.to/septonious\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Credits**\n\n+ SixthSurge for voxelized LPV.\n+ EminGT and gri573 for improved shadow sampling.\n+ CaptTatsu for parts of code I took from BSL.","published":"2022-12-13T19:07:08.160319Z","updated":"2024-01-27T13:16:23.271355Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":499268,"followers":562,"categories":["colored-lighting","fantasy","pbr"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","cartoon","foliage","low","reflections","semi-realistic","shadows"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["y4j12BxK","ogGYWNdQ","bNMgAWCx","YZMWbh4h","xHgx5Bvx","WavyjcdU","IFUoT1yb","ktRmeTUY","AvWzJIv6"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/78660094ffc8b00c1f805137250401309991bc2b.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"AvWzJIv6","project_id":"EpQFjzrQ","author_id":"dilHPVn4","featured":false,"name":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA V0.6b]","version_number":"0.6b","changelog":"Everything has changed\nAdded voxelized LPV (Iris only)\n...","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-27T13:16:24.615915Z","downloads":138353,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"51c9d62618dfaa6bd7c0d913820afac16866b121f718ca1a63497e6ec191f0d83849fd4a7c05fee31179e70f5d7d84523c49b8f83af4212d8376ea0084941800","sha1":"e628f6b7064682f8f3a4a06a2ff981a12b81e722"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/versions/AvWzJIv6/Solas%20Shader%20V2.0%20%5BBETA%200.6b%5D.zip","filename":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA 0.6b].zip","primary":true,"size":1155325,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"FeXBCccN","user":{"id":"dilHPVn4","username":"septonious","name":"Septonious","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83358692?v=4","bio":"I make shaders","created":"2021-07-23T13:39:53.718189Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA 0.6b].zip.disabled"},"mods\\appliedenergistics2-forge-15.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"82b03def4269d2fe052e09a09e7774c10d2889982ac5caa2b7976181ebf784830529febab435847e2966d2ba0bcdd5e0f6d39c831aa7b461809563ff13bd4ef2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XxWD5pD3","slug":"ae2","project_type":"mod","team":"CqWdb4w5","title":"Applied Energistics 2","description":"AE2: A popular automation and storage mod","body":"Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) is a comprehensive mod for Minecraft that introduces a unique approach to in-game inventory management.

This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-04-28T12:55:40.932447Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":431784,"followers":507,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"isHbiIeZ","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":true,"name":"AE2

This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features.

more</li>\n<li><b>Includes built-in titles for many modded dimensions</b> - Atum, Twilight Forest, Bumblezone, Lost Cities, &amp; more!</li>\n<li>Supports <b>all modded biomes</b></li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom titles with the Waystones mod!</b> Will display a Waystone's title when you're near it (1.18+ Forge only)</li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom sounds</b> when entering new biomes, dimensions, or Waystone regions</li>\n<li>Dimension &amp; biome blacklisting</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Beautiful Custom Dimension Titles \n\n<p>\nTry out the beautiful <a title=\"Visual Traveler's Titles\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2024-02-20T23:18:05.163730Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":438441,"followers":644,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI","oUSK4sOQ","MbifZGB0","TTAtymNe","zbwk2CBy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/5f218490f1edb9c55fd18e05f52247727117b93f.png"},"version":{"id":"oUSK4sOQ","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.2 (Forge)","version_number":"1.20-Forge-4.0.2","changelog":"- Added support for the following mods: Mine Cells, Eden Ring, Deeper Darker, Aether, The True Backrooms, VoidZ, Atlantis.  \n- Added partial Chinese and Japanese translations.  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T20:30:04.061112Z","downloads":25538,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7cafbfc39305f3e384468db674e350118950201ba4d22b66ed95516a335aaad04765ae1e693b223c6c5beba404fc7411e9f78b4f962d7d9e51407b55233375a4","sha1":"64a435eaa6e08fff5af2c720c3b6a40fe292f2f7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/versions/oUSK4sOQ/TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar","filename":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":228191,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar"},"mods\\YungsMenuTweaks-1.20.1-Forge-1.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"63085c7e9b668cb381bb2c654953d17420fab93d4be661879251ebc98de90ae1452e51dc7df5450539f5d13b06f48f3fae03f1130e92ae55c2fb098c92684495","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Hcy2DFKF","slug":"yungs-menu-tweaks","project_type":"mod","team":"liWua4gL","title":"YUNG's Menu Tweaks","description":"A small, lightweight mod that makes browsing menus a lot easier","body":"<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/A4TJJrk.png\" alt=\"YUNG's Menu Tweaks\" width=\"1344\" height=\"416\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsapibadge\" alt=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" width=\"211\" height=\"26\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" href=\"https://discord.gg/rns3beq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsdiscordbadge2\" alt=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" width=\"136\" height=\"28\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungstwitterbadge3\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" width=\"104\" height=\"37\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsyoutubebadge\" alt=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Support me on Patreon!\" href=\"https://patreon.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungspatreonbadge\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon!\" width=\"138\" height=\"28\" /></a><br />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AOWnZqG.png\" alt=\"What is this?\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>A lightweight client-side mod that makes navigating Minecraft's menus just a little bit easier.</b></p>\n<p>This mod allows you to:\n<ul>\n<li>Right click cycle buttons to go back to the previous option</li>\n<li>Use the mouse scroll wheel to change slider options</li>\n<li>Change the background of almost every options screen to any texture.

Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":613940,"followers":730,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"edGQD16r","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:28.090790Z","downloads":99507,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9999714ca3dd2f2401f0396ca44f3b27c3784c4f","sha512":"4f75afb703dd71c322d4e2e27d28d7ab4afeb0c242bcee6d1eb5fef59ee4347352f1ca55f1826743957d2e95a951ed13884356485b0a979b14010915079e2c29"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/edGQD16r/carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":439457,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\Chunky-1.3.136.jar":{"sha512":"80d857559983cdfa00b9fdbcccefcfce815a3ca905ab8e4fa4810608499a6b0087e2a562f8289345dae613c0c1b7ca9e7d1d62f536249115a1deded412d2ab20","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fALzjamp","slug":"chunky","project_type":"mod","team":"CohgUIPJ","title":"Chunky","description":"Pre-generates chunks, quickly and efficiently","body":"<h2>Chunky</h2>\n\nPre-generates chunks, quickly, efficiently, and safely\n\n<h3>Features</h3>\n\n- Start one or several chunk generation tasks at the same time (if you want to leverage your CPU more)\n- Pause chunk generation tasks, saving them for later\n- Shows detailed information such as chunks processed, percent to completion, ETA, chunk processing rate, etc\n- Custom world [shapes](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky/wiki/Shapes), and optional world border support with [ChunkyBorder](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunkyborder) installed\n\n<h3>Permissions</h3>\n\nIn order to use chunky you will need to either:\n- Be an operator on a dedicated server.

And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style.

This can be useful for PvP and other scenarios where performance is important\n\nIt is currently **only** tested on a Windows/NVIDIA PC. If you find a bug and want to report it (or give feedback/suggestions), the easiest way to do so is by leaving a comment on the [PMC page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/luracasmus-s-shaders/)\n\n> The name is based on [RenderDragon](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/RenderDragon)\n\n## Performance\n\nThe pack uses several tricks to improve performance in different scenarios, which can lead to FPS being significantly higher in some situations:\n\n* Shadows are automatically disabled when the contrast between sunlight and ambient light is too low, such as at night or during thunderstorms\n* Surfaces that are facing away from the sun never get shadows, which means that looking towards the sun improves performance significantly **(Since version 1.7 this only applies when Translucent Shadows are disabled)**\n* Shadows are completely disabled in The Nether\n\n## Customization\n\nAlmost everything is customizable and can be toggled, including:\n\n* Gamma, Color and Saturation\n* [Tonemap Operators](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tone_mapping)\n* Shadows\n  * Softness, Resolution, Color, Distance, etc.\n* Volumetric Light\n* Sun/moon and Sunlight Brightness\n* Ambient Light\n* Different types of Fog\n* [Ambient Occlusion](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ambient_occlusion)\n* Emissive Redstone, Lapis and Emerald Blocks as well as Flowers and Fungi\n* [FXAA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing)\n* Sharpening\n* Automatic Exposure\n* Bloom\n\nThe pack also allows for some further customization in these files within the pack itself:\n\n* `block.properties`\n* `item.properties`\n\n## How to Install\n\nThe pack requires **[GLSL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OpenGL_Shading_Language) 4.60** / **[OpenGL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OpenGL) 4.6** support (might require updating graphics drivers) as well as **[Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/) 1.7.0 or later**\n\nDownload the ZIP file\n\nDownload and install the latest [Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)\n\nMove the ZIP file into your Shader Packs folder (usually `%AppData%\\.minecraft\\shaderpacks`)\n\nSelect the pack in the Shader Packs menu and choose the appropriate settings profile for your device","published":"2023-04-08T15:43:37.724219Z","updated":"2024-04-26T21:11:11.030078Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":59012,"followers":117,"categories":["low","shadows","vanilla-like"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","potato","semi-realistic"],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["iris"],"versions":["mA4e7gHo","WDKX19uc","HwZlMwgG","YXBJ9OIh","c6ACHlVJ","ohNpIX7b","mA7BvQRi","1kp5uOV3","d7QBDGl3","dpWuMiij","T36FBokb","BtjN9A3V","2WgSMzZC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BrRak9pu/12d9ff0839659be4bd894b8e04ddcbcbeb215fd9.png"},"version":{"id":"BtjN9A3V","project_id":"BrRak9pu","author_id":"uJQGWKKa","featured":false,"name":"v1.10","version_number":"1.10","changelog":"*

The Botany Pot can be used for decoration, and to also make farming certain types of crops much easier. This mod was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/davenonymous/followers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Davenonymous's</a> awesome <a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/bonsai-trees\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bonsai Trees</a> mod.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Harvesting a crop in a Botany Pot will automatically replant the seed.</li>\n<li>Hopper Botany Pot upgrade allows the pot to harvest itself and put items in a chest or other block with an inventory.</li>\n<li>Seventeen different colors!</li>\n<li>Extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/Datapack-Information\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack support</a> for adding new crops, soils, and fertilizers.</li>\n<li>Extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/CraftTweaker-Support#fertilizers\" rel=\"nofollow\">support for CraftTweaker</a> to allow removing, modifying, and adding crops, soils, and fertilizers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>First you need to craft the Botany Pot. Then you must think about the type of crop you want to grow and the soil it grows in. There are many kinds of soil blocks and certain crops will need certain soils. A good example of this is wheat growing in dirt and nether wart growing in soul sand. Once you have the soil and seed for your crop simply right click the block with your soil and then your seed. This will start the growth process for your crop. The crop may take a while to grow, you can speed it up by right clicking with bone meal and other fertilizers. Once the crop is done growing right click it to harvest and automatically plant another. To remove items from the botany pot you can sneak and right click the block with an empty hand. Breaking the block will also work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While this mod may seem simple on it's surface, there are many technical details involved. For those who would like to get a better understanding of the mod you can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/Technical-Info\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technical Information</a> page on the wiki.</p>\n\n<h2>Mod Support</h2>\n<p>This mod uses predefined json files to add support for crops. These json files let you do things like define soils, fertilizers, and new crops. Mod authors and servers can easily add these files to their data packs to customize crops. Additionally users can create and share their own data packs to enable a broader range of mod support.&nbsp; If you would like to add new data for the mod please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki</a> for more information about the mod and where to get help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently Supported</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biomes O' Plenty (15 crops, 3 soils)</li>\n<li>Botania (32 crops, 7 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Buzzier Bees (13 crops)</li>\n<li>Metal Bushes (6 crops)</li>\n<li>Mystical Agriculture(43 crops, 5 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Harvestcraft (78 crops)</li>\n<li>Peanut Mod (1 crop)</li>\n<li>Quark (1 crop, 1 soil)</li>\n<li>Simple Farming (34 crops)</li>\n<li>Snad (2 soils)</li>\n<li>XL Food Mod (6 crops)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Like the mod and want to support me?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n* Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n* Create an overall immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Botania today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://botaniamod.net/index.html)**\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)- - ","published":"2022-05-30T01:13:31.701840Z","updated":"2024-01-02T17:50:49.953180Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":254286,"followers":397,"categories":["decoration","magic","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["mwSLII0N","2P9x6c71","qxd8PXZm","XoXz4jGl","QYXVsA5d","Z0zssckA","KQgw4Ofr","Vez9CKSz","POoLUSdd","p3uKh2pZ","tlZFnGvX","sCqXAdcM","157MUwKP","I1sdolxI","r2awMhqz","4zEqysVf","k3odjPPO","PxWspyO7","A7dLvqQz","MyuQ1tHQ","OD7qkY6n","YKSFC2o4","3LPMxFVf","ruMuBKgi","T1wWMXnl","XiOSfzIW","s2BpxY5Q","Z88fkVtD","fsiPITPT","s3EM29A3","SAIOMqxv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/pfjLUfGv/4c006056fd05fdd63b83d79c7c3bb9712d2f49bc.png"},"version":{"id":"SAIOMqxv","project_id":"pfjLUfGv","author_id":"wlfGXpf5","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-443-forge","version_number":"1.20.1-443-forge","changelog":"https://botaniamod.net/changelog.html#1-20-1-443-fake","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-02T17:50:55.114578Z","downloads":26725,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7a92d400ec5b0901435f67458789b579bfca36161ee5bc4092ab128ef5d18e446bb8fbfd8e29d2bf43aa008799a888330392b36ba84ce3413f3fb76a3db53fe5","sha1":"547f03922777254e2b8d68f6c166f20986b54f23"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/pfjLUfGv/versions/SAIOMqxv/Botania-1.20.1-443-FORGE.jar","filename":"Botania-1.20.1-443-FORGE.jar","primary":true,"size":11709874,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nU0bVIaL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"vvuO3ImH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ZHXzsq7V","user":{"id":"wlfGXpf5","username":"williewillus","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2015032?v=4","bio":"Violet Moon member // Former ProjectE and Twilight Forest contributor","created":"2021-12-23T03:09:28.025799Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Former Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"ZHXzsq7V","user":{"id":"7VguFihs","username":"artemisSystem","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39034386?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-23T18:21:18.750678Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"ZHXzsq7V","user":{"id":"NIvc4iKN","username":"Alwinfy","name":"Alwinfy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20421383?v=4","bio":"I do programming and programming accessories.","created":"2023-02-28T17:27:46.592882Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"ZHXzsq7V","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco Lavos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794735?v=4","bio":"holy hell","created":"2022-11-13T03:09:41.900759Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Botania-1.20.1-443-FORGE.jar"},"mods\\AmbientSounds_FORGE_v5.3.9_mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"04098ce607e0e62f3bd3628c3a4d63f40a5667c37af6b12580d642e0a2e97ce5925c1ef9392217b3bd0c405f82f61e6ca8d837b6d0c82c4d3a4a95f0f0c8725f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fM515JnW","slug":"ambientsounds","project_type":"mod","team":"4RhBAs8B","title":"AmbientSounds","description":"#listentonature","body":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Z1QIyxFUas\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
