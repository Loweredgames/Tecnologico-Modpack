is a datapack that completely revamps the nether, way more than what Minecraft did in the 1.16 Nether Update.\n\n![Incendium Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224804955-2c8a39b1-d015-462b-a28c-dde27f747c90.png)\n\n## Notes\n- Incendium has an optional resourcepack called [Sparkles](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/sparkles)! This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:20:14.180965Z","updated":"2023-12-07T22:25:20.713038Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":358947,"followers":589,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["xnhu8xeb","NoanBvKE","S6fQNiYx","lS3rnfXC","nNDmHrHX","ednvmJkC","wdO4nfDE","QzTAZ3vy","4bK01rdc","g34x6icZ","OamdlEiS","QL8CxhjY","BxVLGy3y"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZVzW5oNS/65c8dcaaf260e5b2182c228a1a442c792a7c4782.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"BxVLGy3y","project_id":"ZVzW5oNS","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v5.3.4 ~ 1.20.4","version_number":"5.3.4","changelog":"# Incendium 5.3.4\n- Officially supports 1.20.3/4\n- Sanctum fixes:\n  - Skeletons will no longer spawn in the structure\n  - Fixed a small section of the maze that was 1 block too high\n  - Sanctum Guardians now wear their armor correctly\n  - Added some structure voids to slightly improve terrain adaptation (but not completely fix)\n- Greatsword of Sacrifice self-damage has been more than doubled, since armor now helps against it\n- Slightly increased the exclusion zone of Incendium structures (so they don't spawn too close to each other)\n- Toxic Slimes should finally no longer die of fall damage\n- Fixed an issue where custom potions lost their effects when using Fabric on 1.20.2\n- Added empty function file for manual compat with other datapacks","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-07T22:25:22.997630Z","downloads":162876,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7339f4da6c9ca9ae73b0a877a0bbaec35fd17961","sha512":"7dea928bb6c35c1a95fa5f4601cddeea08809c2b1d594159330156fe3e96f133c5047b25b71145199d2ace66411f18321678faa24f7e7b543014b487a7f665e3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZVzW5oNS/versions/BxVLGy3y/Incendium_1.20.4_v5.3.4.jar","filename":"Incendium_1.20.4_v5.3.4.jar","primary":true,"size":4185038,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"HfNmMQ9E","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Incendium_1.20.4_v5.3.4.jar"},"mods\\lithium-fabric-mc1.19.4-0.11.1.jar":{"sha512":"f2bd271e30e5ed9f097d592db5e859208a1c6abe727dc51f83879b837c843b4f6453e99f1ca8d5225f896233ab8f7dbbb3300f10396d2a1cd2957937acfd1aa7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gvQqBUqZ","slug":"lithium","project_type":"mod","team":"peSx5UYg","title":"Lithium","description":"No-compromises game logic/server optimization mod","body":"Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note:

client-side mod that adds RPG-like titles when entering biomes or dimensions.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely customizable - change text size, color, location, duration, &amp; more</li>\n<li><b>Includes built-in titles for many modded dimensions</b> - Atum, Twilight Forest, Bumblezone, Lost Cities, &amp; more!</li>\n<li>Supports <b>all modded biomes</b></li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom titles with the Waystones mod!</b> Will display a Waystone's title when you're near it (1.18+ Forge only)</li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom sounds</b> when entering new biomes, dimensions, or Waystone regions</li>\n<li>Dimension &amp; biome blacklisting</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Beautiful Custom Dimension Titles \n\n<p>\nTry out the beautiful <a title=\"Visual Traveler's Titles\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2024-02-20T23:18:05.163730Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":437763,"followers":644,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI","oUSK4sOQ","MbifZGB0","TTAtymNe","zbwk2CBy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/5f218490f1edb9c55fd18e05f52247727117b93f.png"},"version":{"id":"oUSK4sOQ","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.2 (Forge)","version_number":"1.20-Forge-4.0.2","changelog":"- Added support for the following mods: Mine Cells, Eden Ring, Deeper Darker, Aether, The True Backrooms, VoidZ, Atlantis.  \n- Added partial Chinese and Japanese translations.  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T20:30:04.061112Z","downloads":25435,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"64a435eaa6e08fff5af2c720c3b6a40fe292f2f7","sha512":"7cafbfc39305f3e384468db674e350118950201ba4d22b66ed95516a335aaad04765ae1e693b223c6c5beba404fc7411e9f78b4f962d7d9e51407b55233375a4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/versions/oUSK4sOQ/TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar","filename":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":228191,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar"},"mods\\Powah-5.0.5.jar":{"sha512":"8c4d9d14eeb57c2dc889510d3e9894cb9452587f29f1c74c277749920df755b1bcefd2f9998c720b6fc5b42e467eb19db0135f03580cb7ca50c1177005c5ffe5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"KZO4S4DO","slug":"powah","project_type":"mod","team":"J39B2vKM","title":"Powah!","description":"A tech mod that adds various ways to generate, store and transmit Energy.","body":"# Powah!

Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;\n* Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;\n* Create an overall immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Botania today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://botaniamod.net/index.html)**\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)- -

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-02-06T00:32:19.293889Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3757233,"followers":5654,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"oYQsfz9e","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.19 for Minecraft 1.19.4/Sodium mc1.19.4-0.4.10","version_number":"1.0.19+mc1.19.4","changelog":"- Fix Sodium dependency (Modrinth CI) (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.19+mc1.19.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-06T04:19:11.564200Z","downloads":72990,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"676e217ba05ff49c3e8d5d801f7c157b5b988eb21a44694d5c72a279dcdfe30933f57639a66d9f49b9b10c26edb288e8aa212ba27d4bd9abe0212c52b2e9b193","sha1":"55638e279d8a19ea5df67ff86feb6350e95376e1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/oYQsfz9e/indium-1.0.19%2Bmc1.19.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.19+mc1.19.4.jar","primary":true,"size":104841,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"b4hTi3mo","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.19+mc1.19.4.jar"},"mods\\iris-mc1.19.4-1.6.11.jar":{"sha512":"21ccce28b7db38abc8cd04ff34b0f039dd2091a484327c5d131b4c0ae42af04ece749f39bdb042e272fc69d5cce99ba8336291410f4aac2d460b51ae133588e1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YL57xq9U","slug":"iris","project_type":"mod","team":"1HMZl6Mn","title":"Iris Shaders","description":"A modern shaders mod for Minecraft intended to be compatible with existing OptiFine shader packs","body":"![Iris: An open-source shaders mod compatible with OptiFine shaderpacks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IrisShaders/Iris/trunk/docs/banner.png)\n\n## Links\n\n* **Visit [our website](https://irisshaders.dev) for downloads and pretty screenshots!**\n* **Visit [the shaders section](https://modrinth.com/shaders) to find shader packs!**\n* Visit [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu) to chat about the mod and get support!

release the shutter.<br>\n- Press/Hold Sneak when looking through Viewfinder to control Camera\nsettings: Focal Length, Shutter Speed, Flash mode, Composition Guides.<br>\n- Use the Camera while sneaking to open the Attachments window,\nwhere you'd be able to:\n    - Load a Film\n    - Equip the Flash (Redstone Lamp)\n    - Modify the Lens (Spyglass)\n    - Put a Filter on the lens (Glass Panes)\n\n<h3>Film</h3>\n\n- To capture an image you'll need to expose light-sensitive film.\n- You can use simpler black and white film or, more sophisticated\nand harder to make and process, color film.\n- Single film roll can fit 16 frames on it.\n- Developing is required to prepare film for printing.\n\n<h3>Lightroom</h3>\n\n- Photographs are printed with the help of a Lightroom block.\n- Negatives can be previewed before printing to help you choose the\nbest exposure.\n- Black and white print requires Paper and Black Dye.\nColor print will require Cyan, Magenta and Yellow dyes on top of that.\n\n<h3>Photograph</h3>\n\nAnd finally, you have your Photograph - a captured moment in time!\nNow it's time to admire the result, hang it on the wall, share with\nfriends, sell it to the National Geographic. The possibilities are endless.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n__Known incompatibilities:__\n- Optifine - known for causing problems with other mods. Use Sodium/Embeddium instead.\n- Visual Overhaul - crashes when opening camera controls - [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mortuusars/Exposure/issues/19)\n- Exordium - causes issues and flickering when looking through viewfinder.\n- FastAnim (Fabric) - breaks player model animations with camera.

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-04-23T23:09:45.445513Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":5012532,"followers":4701,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"17Hi340V","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:07:52.006115Z","downloads":548845,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"a184f3a963c07f7026fb6d8ccd83ca29e7f7b009","sha512":"14f6b9b3161d6ebeaefaa1efc08b72a98d82aacf6f9956c3a5bff9daaae3d0200cfdb2034c2321849acf0aafaf0450cbd075a92138e1500f31a70666c59e258f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/17Hi340V/entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":62127,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":null,"bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

If you don't want that you can disable it in the config.\n\nIt contains:\n\n- The name of the player\n- The dimension the player died in\n- The date the player died\n- The coordinates where the player died\n- An image of the player with its equipment at the time of death\n- A list of every item the player had when he died\n\nIf you don't want to keep the obituary after you recovered your items, you can enable the automatic removal in the config.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mc2CMaK.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vOVetsl.png)\n\n## Naming the Grave\nIf you break the grave with silk touch, you get it dropped as an item.\nYou can also craft graves.\n\nNaming the grave in an anvil, allows you to have custom text displayed on your grave.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fB6gl6Y.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/auVMOS1.png)\n\n## Customization\nThere are several things you can change in the configs:\n\n- The color of the text on the grave\n- If the skull on the grave should be rendered\n- Whether you want to get the obituary on death\n- The blocks that can get replaced by a grave\n- If the death note should get removed form the players inventory when breaking a grave\n- If only the owners of the grave should be able to break it\n- If a ghost of the player should spawn when breaking the grave\n- If the ghost should be friendly and defend the player or if it should attack the player\n- If the grave should get broken when sneaking on the grave\n- If the items should get sorted back into their original slots when breaking the grave\n\n## Recovering Lost Items (1.16.3+)\nIf you somehow lost your items you can recover them with the recover command.\n\nThe syntax is `/restore <player> <death_id> <replace|add>`.\n\nThe parameter `player` is the player whose inventory should get restored.\n\nThe parameter `death_id` is the ID of the death. You can find it out by enabling advanced tooltips (F3 + H) and opening the obituary. The death ID also gets written into the logs if a grave couldn't get placed.\n\nThe last parameter defines if you want to get the players inventory replaced (Overwritten) or added (Just adds the items to the players existing inventory).\n\n\nYou can also get a pre made restore command by sneaking and right-clicking the obituary as an admin.\n\n\n## Edge Cases\nIf you die inside a block, the grave is placed at the next empty space above your location. If there is no free block above your position, or you are above the build limit, your items drop as usual.\n\nIf you fall into the void, the grave is placed at the lowest point in the world where blocks can be placed.

Any storage devices connected to the same network are accessible to the player through one simple Grid interface, allowing the player to access the inventories of many devices through a single unified GUI.\n\nThis mod not only adds storage solutions, but also devices that can be used to manipulate items and blocks in the world and from within the system, such as importers, exporters, constructors, destructors, and more! There are also devices in this mod that allow the player to setup auto-crafting, allowing the crafting of complex recipes in a few simple clicks.\n","published":"2023-07-04T19:57:06.910375Z","updated":"2024-03-07T20:07:11.730268Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":72702,"followers":80,"categories":["storage","technology","transportation"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["oowA5Iwd","YZ0XR5II","HK9EOQ6p","aCrAVeyn","lSA2ilHm","CCtmznuk","1u9nLHLo","rHueOf4K","6XyJwQKE","qRdhlTZp","FfIoyI6k","bcveRhzK","b2wDRWW0","YArOFHJ8","QqMSPKBK","awgGK8og","diMuliGc","U4nNlVxy","9FSDP48t","zPblpnEM","FySVyBpx","MQWT9X6A","UtZkUUCC","VT4IJBdn","LHsKBCVY","ji5sIFmE","JKXOx3U4","tsV0so7y","wByAoycD","2Sdp1wuJ","I4OZ1vjL","l3Hj2lCH","4lAVcnxE","yZKcLCtD","ZWIMoEm4","FFosy93i","otIZHPMB","Lgcu6H34","XrNGoESV","9HIc9bq8","ZJJrTq6j","jR0gHa8j","pGA1mssN","Lf8A87Lm","wmpOUSBT","bcaF7u53","XB1hEZZU","XKhMNnMe","5pDg4ocp","K1YTksBI","YSl9RdcK","vDN0DgIt","JBciyoWo","DokWcz17","oYb3BY8l","jZ84LrRR","aRcAgbFe","WiGHtCXv","E3XCJ2TW","X4typAJg","3088TO5v","SBfLibBt","ScUf0R8q","zFl6azVW","JCjhS9wH","NFMdTqLm","jK7AAj6u","PudOOyk9","Eq7JaN60","cCwA23Yj","EoYGhGlT","XjPaOboi","loHh6k6J","ru9HTua0","2Gpz1XMC","iR6GHjuH","YEvBoSCx","NZfnBHnF","X8KPs07l","VfYyJ2IJ","zBAFajps","dIfSILQG","uW06BZym","70sTOize","NRLMtFLA","xr5S678d","t1QPUhlp","t1KRd03U","N7kjrUuq","gL1kQrec","2lZ9sQgb","oWHL6FCy","2toxAjDL","ObjqCEtC","ei75WFFQ","aYtH6Iyj","rxSPbKKz","tMS7tS3l","jrlKwDdU","ebflXOrE","kOZYWqvv","XXDjnJjb","ubVR7Qo2","LgOoLMb3","9FdMY5Uh","q0upZGyZ","JtP0PfDW","rLxnC9rX","KQUlf68j","Q0JvA1hs","9A44DGnE","nyFJpM9r","5LJgalvR","b3EnMurH","WXc7Lduy","1KnpObYz","OCkiDRqI","G3U09EQR","o2cBXo5K","obWjt4eG","IfASYu3s","ZwA2eWbr","lduq40MS","bqOGk9wF","SMmGjwzY","E6IGnQVV","GstFHtQu","2PhMGrPC","lJWYzpXy","p2pc3XkZ","aFEIrETt","GH3gS21C","xEybRLzR","swrHncYx","PJJvJnrc","Map4zjlx","dNBGpoJE","rG3uuKl9","MjxkrtDM","eyqekIYi","oiiKEr6C","E1cAiFLP","AdgoNEer","vYmGIsfv","OOG4TZdH","b8RJOn2m","NUXYAExM","gtJEVdC4","9nMM8BQd","PuKbgH68","8WrJfY2W","i3HoGPiT","Y1Spkg9x","9bPnZGVd","BNdtdvCF","zd9efSD4","mz38svG6","aXkKelNh","4TWwqV8M","1j5w4uTI","o7aP9aNA","otvP5RZZ","p2TmY5gl","QiYjDNCR","MvQHq8zk","VnAoDoy4","YEzRaiSl","PxiUp4pX","MXhJ6DEx","Zk4gZCdu","SybYrvdy","2ccDXLcI","Qk9oKmsE","RjD1Ok08","XlrINGwZ","G5PUHGAS","ECyJMVne","Tc2gNFEM","zYkzZ6Xc","a5e5AmCN","DN8Ndu2z","toGMhAa9","SsaOW1Yw","j5lD9SbE","8t7bcFA9","AsQLO343","GCFUJQJZ","VqvidqKg","axXYroni","2B7oLBNz","5z23XIQC","fmgKjOC6","H33Uj6Nl","sVAWpSX7","liJvph0l","PrJ56qWO","BELprT7d","93bqP28J","11oqJDaD","PXGnRC2r","X9Cp27r1","KSkh6Cmx","wEzhu0F6","CleXWjNW","mYiMojAz","rBWghJM3","Bq0JVXcm","5QS0MMSd","IX4Uxowu","bNAyBCTf","aVBhDTuO","g6Q8lhxz","qbD7GpRs","YmTvTSr5","gbf0Byhx","IA9VYo9N","i4l5Nhss","7Dtzai2a","o6pw67te","eXbe0Vzy","WD1pFMBR","MzQ0XcZA","HGQ0nVyD","hEt2dHSt","A6eJcOW1","t5HOPjQj","R0JZjvEg","HVJXQFgA","LAuDZDb1","NcJeKAfX","zGJtrgXl","sv5wexKZ","CwaJX9mJ","Z4ZwfsmH","DlxhxAMG","ubJGKwUA","hAfmTW4i","yttzXk4M","pZhGDWZf","F1AuMcg9","Qf5sD6tZ","2P23ravQ","O5LHCcWZ","Os6A9619","gAZ6iwUG","xm4PUTvq","dSDQRLVO","YbG0afid","vxhFf3p6","DiI2vAev","ZITLFjjf","q3LiZwUb","KylQm6oT","gx6X1mWN","D7iX5EWz","rxLqtfB4","9qoWFpaq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KDvYkUg3/be094d898dbfe003baaa6e86098145eec8dbec9b.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"ZITLFjjf","project_id":"KDvYkUg3","author_id":"R9RLzzR6","featured":false,"name":"v1.12.4","version_number":"1.12.4","changelog":"###

Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively. </center></h3> \n<br/>\n<h6><center><b>Now with Dark mode!! check the configs to enable it!</b></center></h6>\n\n<h5><center><b>This Mod works on <a href= https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge alt=\"FORGE\"> FORGE</a> and <a href= https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/ alt=\"FABRIC\"> FABRIC</a>.</b></center></h5>\n\n## HOW IT WORKS:\n\n    1. Click on the button in your inventory or assign a key to open the gui.\n\n    2. Click on the button next to the sound you want to muffle.\n\n    3.  Optional: set the volume of the sound dragging the slider around.\n\n    4. Optional: press the play button to be sure that's the sound you want to muffle.\n\n    5. Enjoy peace.\n\n## What about Anchors?\n#### Anchors are ranged mufflers, for when you want to muffle a sound on a small area.\n\n    1. Open your ESM Screen\n\n    2. Select one of the 10 numbered buttons\n\n    3. Press the marker like button on the right panel to set the Anchor position\n\n    4. Optional: press the edit Anchor button (next to marker) and set the name and range of the Anchor\n\n    5. Muffle the sounds and enjoy ranged peace\n\n#### You can change the Anchor position whenever you want by pressing the marker button.\n\n## Inventory button\n\n#### if you don't like the ESM muffler in the inventory, you can disable it in the config. \n#### if you don't like the position of the button, you can hold right mouse button over the muffler button and drag it wherever you want.\n\n## Most things are configurable! like:\n\n - You can put the muffle and play buttons on the left right of the screen for easier visuals.\n - You can disable the anchors.\n - You can blacklist sounds to prevent them to appear in the ESM screen.\n - You can choose the default muffle volume.\n - You can disable the Inventory button\n\n<a href=

Key to this are World Cores - found hidden at the bottom of each chunk. World Cores can also be used to build a World Forge, which provides the ability to refine raw dirt and stone into more World Cores.\n\nThere are two options for how the generated - missing chunks are either empty (making a skyworld), or are replaced with bedrock (sealing them).\n\nIn Forge and Fabric you can now configure Chunk By Chunk from the main menu, using the Mods... menu prior to creating a world to configure the settings for that world. For fabric this requires the Mod Menu mod. For Quilt this is not available yet.

Both are done by blurring the texture of the block, doing some calculations and applying that color to the scene with.\n\nMost other shaderpacks with 3D volumetric clouds have a problem of them leaking into closed spaces like caves or mountains. Solas fixes that problem by toggling a cloud shadow check in cases when a closed space is detected, thus essentially turning volumetric clouds into volumetric light.\n\nAnother problem a lot of shaderpacks have is shadow light leaking and peter panning which is not minimized in Solas.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Key Features**\n+ 3D volumetric clouds and light rays.\n+ Volumetric Nether and End fog.\n+ Water, atmospheric and border fog.\n+ Fast colored lighting and global illumination.\n+ Fancy sky effects: aurora borealis, Milky Way, ender nebula, ender vortex and more.\n+ Cinematic post effects: bloom, chromatic aberration, depth of field, image sharpening, adjustable and flexible tonemap, TAA, FXAA.\n+ Integrated PBR resourcepack with generated emissives, specular and normals.\n+ Support for PBR respurcepacks.\n+ Advanced lighting model: vanilla & custom ambient occlusion, variable penumbra shadows.\n+ Many customizable options with their proper translations to English, Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish languages.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Support my work on Boosty!**\n\nhttps://boosty.to/septonious\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Credits**\n\n+ SixthSurge for voxelized LPV.\n+ EminGT and gri573 for improved shadow sampling.\n+ CaptTatsu for parts of code I took from BSL.","published":"2022-12-13T19:07:08.160319Z","updated":"2024-01-27T13:16:23.271355Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":498489,"followers":562,"categories":["colored-lighting","fantasy","pbr"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","cartoon","foliage","low","reflections","semi-realistic","shadows"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["y4j12BxK","ogGYWNdQ","bNMgAWCx","YZMWbh4h","xHgx5Bvx","WavyjcdU","IFUoT1yb","ktRmeTUY","AvWzJIv6"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/78660094ffc8b00c1f805137250401309991bc2b.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"AvWzJIv6","project_id":"EpQFjzrQ","author_id":"dilHPVn4","featured":false,"name":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA V0.6b]","version_number":"0.6b","changelog":"Everything has changed\nAdded voxelized LPV (Iris only)\n...","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-27T13:16:24.615915Z","downloads":137918,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e628f6b7064682f8f3a4a06a2ff981a12b81e722","sha512":"51c9d62618dfaa6bd7c0d913820afac16866b121f718ca1a63497e6ec191f0d83849fd4a7c05fee31179e70f5d7d84523c49b8f83af4212d8376ea0084941800"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/versions/AvWzJIv6/Solas%20Shader%20V2.0%20%5BBETA%200.6b%5D.zip","filename":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA 0.6b].zip","primary":true,"size":1155325,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"FeXBCccN","user":{"id":"dilHPVn4","username":"septonious","name":"Septonious","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83358692?v=4","bio":"I make shaders","created":"2021-07-23T13:39:53.718189Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA 0.6b].zip"},"mods\\PackagedAuto-1.20.1-3.4.5.18.jar":{"sha512":"3ee5c2142425b7532abf7bcb5d98ea30f00c92773c1d49a17bb1fa7a26cee955f1ef9e2f45eca2cb3011422d6990072937f300a86bd3a44595bd0600a0b4a92c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ugIdhQx4","slug":"packagedauto","project_type":"mod","team":"vPyXtMZk","title":"PackagedAuto","description":"Enhancing Autocrafting with Packages","body":"<p>PackagedAuto is an addon to <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2\">Applied Energistics 2</a>, and it aims to use \"packages\" of items to allow autocrafting with more than 9 items, and for 1.18.1+, fluid crafting is also supported.

Both machines tell the ME Network what it can do according to the pattern holder, and the Packager, when connected, ejects packages into the network.</p>\n<p>No Fabric port is currently planned, however if anyone wants to do a port, you are welcome to do so.</p>","published":"2024-02-15T12:42:51.469893Z","updated":"2024-04-21T12:23:35.148222Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1052,"followers":1,"categories":["technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["V1aHxTtv","KD0OgaVp","qh8qOOk5","l6F90xpn","VgUbhk1E","vVRlg6W4","qtxHOsLG","e3SmQMRY","sBmdst4t","9rxr3ygC","JHSm24OL","cEhcGAjX","BfqXRZ1g","ajUR5Mrj","XQfXfipy","Nl3pHRAG","HpOl6uXN","J3pUKWiL","CV1FjDUw","Ak7T5jnN","daPJzSYs","ETigH7El","5Kqa5UXL","I5kxwAKU","nVFCIFcU","qLmpy4lI","aPTJ8TYv","OMCp832x","wUr866Iu","hEmXQrmZ","gBK9F49c","UwdqbapH","qXjlMGWa","Ez8ApqBs","zqEe2g0p","S4InyILx","8KU1dKzv","pGcHTFFX","ArjDSHT0","cuwDzAEv","UE5sUSrn","zhjTzO1L","9tmIWbsl","AHbEA19I","xFhm27KN","6kQ8Wd6O","pHjoHMI5","Bx678U17","jvcRvHoA","XhJjspXD","5CX7bqru","b0R93iG5","g8t9zU3A","VzVyRW6W"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ugIdhQx4/5077052e89780b49cddb430173097ac425c29441.png"},"version":{"id":"b0R93iG5","project_id":"ugIdhQx4","author_id":"dO4wxcIT","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-3.4.5.18","version_number":"1.20.1-3.4.5.18","changelog":"Added recipe lookup to the fluid amount specification stack  \r\nReduce ghost ingredient handler area  \r\nDo not focus on the text field in the amount specification UI by default  \r\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-20T20:33:27.520750Z","downloads":42,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3ee5c2142425b7532abf7bcb5d98ea30f00c92773c1d49a17bb1fa7a26cee955f1ef9e2f45eca2cb3011422d6990072937f300a86bd3a44595bd0600a0b4a92c","sha1":"eb4283fe858607bd16a8824ff9104f5b1c3930e2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ugIdhQx4/versions/b0R93iG5/PackagedAuto-1.20.1-3.4.5.18.jar","filename":"PackagedAuto-1.20.1-3.4.5.18.jar","primary":true,"size":384339,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"9cbb9fb4c2f5aa2c2d1f0c0d0881dfa5ee348cbe3148af965995b8d64c88dc0d14e3ab946b99cf5e6c5338ff740dc2fea064d22b2586c63de01e52d2b054591c","sha1":"c2db5cce9e3d623125e45f39aec02fb6592dcec5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ugIdhQx4/versions/b0R93iG5/PackagedAuto-1.20.1-3.4.5.18-sources.jar","filename":"PackagedAuto-1.20.1-3.4.5.18-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":208345,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"XxWD5pD3","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"vPyXtMZk","user":{"id":"dO4wxcIT","username":"TheLMiffy1111","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6522061?v=4","bio":"Add a bio","created":"2021-11-23T19:32:47.085957Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PackagedAuto-1.20.1-3.4.5.18.jar"},"mods\\reeses_sodium_options-1.6.3+mc1.19.4-build.90.jar":{"sha512":"f263a7caeb5918448cd6762195d61015d3ff000482630d306db169fc0aa59d500253f8be9fb4ad55d434850b12f8182f8b00339b9fd05061b47b8b1d84020e9c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Bh37bMuy","slug":"reeses-sodium-options","project_type":"mod","team":"MlZUm0f7","title":"Reese's Sodium Options","description":"Alternative Options Menu for Sodium","body":"Replaces Sodium's Options Screen with intention of improving UX\n\n \n\n# Features\n- Search Bar.\n- Slider values can be changed while holding down `SHIFT` key and scrolling.\n- Scrollable Tabs\n- Scrollable Pages (Overall better UX when using with Sodium Extra).\n- Iris Shader Pack Button.\n \n\n# Screenshot\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/KBsXRBI.png)\n\n![image2](https://i.imgur.com/UjVSMcC.png)\n\n\n# Requirements\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)\n\n\n#### Please do not go and ask CaffeineMC to support this.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements.

The Botany Pot can be used for decoration, and to also make farming certain types of crops much easier. This mod was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/davenonymous/followers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Davenonymous's</a> awesome <a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/bonsai-trees\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bonsai Trees</a> mod.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Harvesting a crop in a Botany Pot will automatically replant the seed.</li>\n<li>Hopper Botany Pot upgrade allows the pot to harvest itself and put items in a chest or other block with an inventory.</li>\n<li>Seventeen different colors!</li>\n<li>Extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/Datapack-Information\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack support</a> for adding new crops, soils, and fertilizers.</li>\n<li>Extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/CraftTweaker-Support#fertilizers\" rel=\"nofollow\">support for CraftTweaker</a> to allow removing, modifying, and adding crops, soils, and fertilizers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>First you need to craft the Botany Pot. Then you must think about the type of crop you want to grow and the soil it grows in. There are many kinds of soil blocks and certain crops will need certain soils. A good example of this is wheat growing in dirt and nether wart growing in soul sand. Once you have the soil and seed for your crop simply right click the block with your soil and then your seed. This will start the growth process for your crop. The crop may take a while to grow, you can speed it up by right clicking with bone meal and other fertilizers. Once the crop is done growing right click it to harvest and automatically plant another. To remove items from the botany pot you can sneak and right click the block with an empty hand. Breaking the block will also work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While this mod may seem simple on it's surface, there are many technical details involved. For those who would like to get a better understanding of the mod you can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/Technical-Info\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technical Information</a> page on the wiki.</p>\n\n<h2>Mod Support</h2>\n<p>This mod uses predefined json files to add support for crops. These json files let you do things like define soils, fertilizers, and new crops. Mod authors and servers can easily add these files to their data packs to customize crops. Additionally users can create and share their own data packs to enable a broader range of mod support.&nbsp; If you would like to add new data for the mod please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki</a> for more information about the mod and where to get help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently Supported</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biomes O' Plenty (15 crops, 3 soils)</li>\n<li>Botania (32 crops, 7 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Buzzier Bees (13 crops)</li>\n<li>Metal Bushes (6 crops)</li>\n<li>Mystical Agriculture(43 crops, 5 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Harvestcraft (78 crops)</li>\n<li>Peanut Mod (1 crop)</li>\n<li>Quark (1 crop, 1 soil)</li>\n<li>Simple Farming (34 crops)</li>\n<li>Snad (2 soils)</li>\n<li>XL Food Mod (6 crops)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Like the mod and want to support me?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Maintained and kept up to date for modern versions of Minecraft and fully compatible with multiplayer!\n\nThe Aether centers around a dimension high in the sky, filled with **vast skylands** of clouds and **floating islands**. This dimension features its own new survival adventure, based around a basic vanilla-esque **survival progression** that features **new ores**, **mythical mobs**, and **three perilous dungeons** each with their own **powerful loot items**.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image0.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ What's in the Mod ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether consists of many new accessible features, most of which are explained in the original forum post for the [Aether Collaboration Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275355-1-7-3-aether-collaboration-mod-v1-02-new-mobs). A brief overview of this content includes:\n* A Hostile Paradise in the sky: the Aether dimension! Just make sure not to fall off of it, or you’ll end up back in the Overworld.\n* A range of new blocks and items accessible from the dimension itself.\n* 3 utility blocks: The Altar, Freezer, and Incubator.\n* 4 material tiers: Skyroot, Holystone, Zanite, and Gravitite, each with their own tools and weapons with unique abilities.\n* The Book of Lore, complete with an entry for every block and item in the mod.\n* An accessory system that lets you utilize the loot you discover.\n* Mobs both reminiscent of the Overworld and unique to the Aether.\n* Moas: a flying mob mount with different tiers of differing jump counts.\n* 3 new structures to conquer: the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Dungeons, each with their own equipment to loot and bosses to defeat.\n* Eternal Day, only able to be ended once the final dungeon is conquered, then the day cycle can be controlled with a unique utility block: the Sun Altar.\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Getting Started ☁️</center></h2>\n\nTo get started with the Aether, you must construct a portal with a **Glowstone frame** and light it with a **water bucket** in the middle, this will activate the portal and allow you to step through and enter the dimension. From here you can begin your survival in the Aether’s hostile paradise!\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image1.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Conquering Dungeons ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether's world contains three new mysterious dungeons, each with a fearsome boss to defeat...\n\nThe **Bronze Dungeon** is the home of the Sentries and guarded by the ominous **Slider**, a creature born of pure stone. Look out for hidden tunnels through islands and prepare yourself with the best gear you can craft!\n\nThe **Silver Dungeon** is the beautiful Valkyrie Temple. Challenge the knights of the Valkyrie Order and, if you prove worthy, fight the **Valkyrie Queen** herself. Utilize every tool and trick you can to best this ancient warrior. \n\nWithin the rare **Gold Dungeon** lies the **Sun Spirit**, an eternal being of pure fire and energy. He is the God that rules the very Sun itself and will take some convincing to even pay attention to a being such as yourself. But it is rumored he guards some of the best treasure that exists in the Aether.  \n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image2.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Join the Conversation ☁️</center></h2>\n\nCome join our Discord server to chat with a growing community of over 10,000 members!\n\nHave a question for the developers?

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Locomotion\" - the \"railyard\" of the Thermal Series - Rails and Minecarts to expand rail-centric gameplay.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-04-28T12:27:03.013798Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2785971,"followers":3347,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"M9XF5FlW","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.3","version_number":"3.4.3","changelog":"Changes:\n\n-

The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

[Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/main/thermal/changelog.md)__\n\n---\n\nThermal gets Agrarian!\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Cultivation\" - a collection of farming and food related things to make your world more agrarian and delicious!\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans.

is a small add-on mod to reshape the world so that landmasses are further apart, varying in size and shape.\n\n![Continents Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224796762-4d07bc2e-c7a9-4dc1-a77a-32596ca1860d.png)\n\n## Notes\n- See how the continent world layout looks per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n- Continents is compatible with most worldgen datapacks, including Terralith\n- Large Biomes works with this - unless Terralith or another similar datapack is installed\n\n## Description\nOne of the most popular requests we've seen, Continents lets you sail massive oceans, and stumble across huge continents. In between continents are plenty of islands to keep your sailing interesting. When you spawn in your world, you are guarenteed to always spawn on a medium-sized continent, which averages around 1k blocks in size.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:59:13.926134Z","updated":"2023-12-07T22:27:43.995077Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":121609,"followers":452,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["dPu3Vari","LzujJLvj","VkN0FzoZ","vnU7SRtZ","CC2weljw","c4OJ366p","C1wKjYGi","WHW8ec8k"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bQ5TJA1E/24d971d6f7661d03bd81195111c9afd5a9eaa537.png"},"version":{"id":"WHW8ec8k","project_id":"bQ5TJA1E","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v1.1.4 ~ 1.20.4","version_number":"1.1.4","changelog":"# Continents 1.1.4\n- Officially supports 1.20.3/4\n- Added empty function file for manual compat with other datapacks","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-07T22:27:45.144443Z","downloads":80322,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"2347c5f80c88d278bac3e9b8472ddc18405110b53a365126b3ae4a485c9e416024f125b98dac2ee863a3ced6a0ccc353ff4ad9aa3e1ec5a8197bfd02eb176608","sha1":"ac067d62ccdb97895305d11e03adabfe4172bfaa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bQ5TJA1E/versions/WHW8ec8k/Continents_1.20.4_v1.1.4.jar","filename":"Continents_1.20.4_v1.1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":58167,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Continents_1.20.4_v1.1.4.jar"},"mods\\ctov-forge-3.4.3.jar":{"sha512":"a21bfc3ec85578d86ad3bbfb818e25288a6f30cabdbc6d85f63e7e83aeb1cd2a02f8c2b85f916e083c7d785198d7b8ba145358f7f83d142dde71b0aefcb9e6e6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fgmhI8kH","slug":"ct-overhaul-village","project_type":"mod","team":"Zs08w8wX","title":"ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village","description":"Enhances and creates new villages and pillager outposts, that perfectly fit into your Minecraft world.","body":"**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_HEADER.webp)**\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER1.webp)**\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is a mod that adds new and improved villages and pillager outposts to Minecraft.** It is available for both Forge and Fabric, and it works with most world-generation and structure mods. CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">chunk grid</strong>. The chunk grid shows you where block chunks begin and end.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">slime chunks</strong>&nbsp;mode. The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\".

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

This can be any part of the tree. The sapling will automatically be replaced, by using what the tree drops. There are many checks in the mod, from preventing accidental harvesting of houses made from logs to what leaves should decay.<br><br>By default the harvesting only works when holding the crouch button, but this can be toggled in the config. For more feature examples see below. There are lots of config options to tweak the mod exactly to your liking.</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Features with the default configuration settings:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>All trees, vanilla and modded, can be harvested quickly by crouching and chopping down one block.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The time it takes to chop down a tree is determined by the amount of logs in it.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Leaves will decay very quickly after harvesting a tree.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Saplings will be replaced after the last leaf has been decayed.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Warped trees, in the nether, can be harvested quickly.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Huge mushrooms can also be harvested quickly<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Certain axe types can be exempted from harvesting trees via a blacklist.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Many checks to determine what is a tree and what isn't. No accidental destroying of houses.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>When two types of trees are next to each other, only the leaves of the tree broken will decay.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Compatible with other mods.<br></span><br><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-size:20px\">Configurable:</span> <span style=\"color:#008000;font-size:14px\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.information/wiki/how-to-configure-mods\" rel=\"nofollow\">(&nbsp;how do I configure?&nbsp;)</a></span><br></strong><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>mustHoldAxeForTreeHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, tree harvesting only works when a player is holding an axe in the main hand.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>treeHarvestWithoutSneak</strong>&nbsp;(default = false): If enabled, tree harvesting works when not holding the sneak button. If disabled it's reversed, and only works when sneaking.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>automaticallyFindBottomBlock</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): Whether the mod should attempt to find the actual bottom log of the tree and start there. This means you can break a tree in the middle and it will still completely be felled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableFastLeafDecay</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the leaves around a broken tree will quickly disappear.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableNetherTrees</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the warped stem/crimson trees in the nether will also be chopped down quickly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableHugeMushrooms</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, giant/huge mushrooms will also be chopped down quickly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>ignorePlayerMadeTrees</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, trees with leaves placed by players won't be destroyed.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceSaplingOnTreeHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a tree is harvested.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceMushroomOnMushroomHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a huge mushroom is harvested and 'enableHugeMushrooms' is enabled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, for every log harvested, the axe held loses durability.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): Here you can set how much durability chopping down a tree should take from the axe. For example if set to 0.1, this means that every 10 logs take 1 durability.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, players' exhaustion level increases 0.005 per harvested log (Minecraft's default per broken block) * increaseExhaustionModifier.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): This determines how much exhaustion should be added to the player per harvested log. By default 0.005 * 1.0.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseHarvestingTimePerLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, harvesting time will increase per existing log in the tree. The amount is determined by 'increasedHarvestingTimePerLogModifier'.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increasedHarvestingTimePerLogModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 0.1, min 0.01, max 10.0): How much longer it takes to harvest a tree with 'increaseHarvestingTimePerLog' enabled. The actual speed is: newSpeed = originalSpeed / (1 + (logCount * increasedHarvestingTimePerLogModifier)).</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>amountOfLeavesBrokenPerTick</strong>&nbsp;(default = 3, min 1, max 16): How many leaves should be broken per tick after a tree has been harvested. Increasing this will speed up the fast leaf decay, but costs more processing power per tick.</span><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Axe Blacklist Feature:</strong></span><br>It's possible to only allow certain axes to harvest trees. On first load of the mod a blacklist file is generated. It is located at <strong><em>./config/treeharvester/harvestable_axe_blacklist.txt</em></strong>.

automatic data and resource packs.</p>\n<p>Usually, data packs have to be loaded separately for every world. Paxi adds the <b><em>paxi</em></b> folder in your Minecraft config folder, where you can place data and resource packs that will automatically be loaded for every world. The first time you run Paxi, the <b><em>paxi&nbsp;</em></b>folder will be created for you in your Minecraft config directory.</p>\n\n<p>Paxi is as simple as it gets when it comes to global data and resource packs, making it a great utility for modpack creators!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9VzCAAC.png\" alt=\"Data packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nWithin the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <b><em>datapacks</em></b> folder for data packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play - in other words, globally loaded data packs! When in game, use the command <code>/datapack list</code> to see all loaded data packs; packs loaded by Paxi are printed in pink text. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.</p>\n\n<p>\nData packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>datapack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of data pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your data packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any data packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal data packs). So if you only have a few data packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSWd9iG.png\" alt=\"Resource Packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAlso within the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <em><b>resourcepacks</b></em> folder for resource packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you run the game with Paxi installed. Any resource packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded when you start the game. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported. Resource packs are not supported on dedicated servers, since they only affect the game on the client-side (textures, sounds, and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>\nResource packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>resourcepack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of resource pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your resource packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any resource packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal resource packs). So if you only have a few resource packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:58:44.154428Z","updated":"2024-02-20T23:19:50.027589Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":315337,"followers":172,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["fZAUUop4","PGslvGfk","nAUDoZw6","guE4gNYH","QzQxGeh0","ncI5s51y","PndwEY0C","t0EvcKWk","C7buFh0l","UVPLKCqf","dfKKJWz8","kOPN246o"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CU0PAyzb/a44cd118cf27547d17dc13a008cdb4efe53aa6d1.png"},"version":{"id":"C7buFh0l","project_id":"CU0PAyzb","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0 (Forge)","version_number":"1.20-Forge-4.0","changelog":"1.20 and 1.20.1 release!  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-12T22:26:03.431847Z","downloads":65047,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"50ed8c99981b9860c846a18cda215d388b67019b76a172833fa4e4b52cbd122eb8e49e594e5789790f95af06e0a98dcf2433b001b1f559b3e7071d2e6b7c1dd7","sha1":"a3a7008e07a27b3c831af7e4c82fbbc10a4da328"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CU0PAyzb/versions/C7buFh0l/Paxi-1.20-Forge-4.0.jar","filename":"Paxi-1.20-Forge-4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":96892,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uDMN8ZzP","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Paxi-1.20-Forge-4.0.jar"},"mods\\fastback-0.15.6+1.20.1-forge.jar":{"sha512":"d6d901100ac1dbdbd508d1dd33fdf1aa4d8d8cfb342f49b2628644e4cd086ccce8297ae041310fdd277810c9716825206383b5a72cdbbfcda8309cea204dd713","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZHKrK8Rp","slug":"fastback","project_type":"mod","team":"3KF3R10i","title":"Fast Backups","description":"Fast, incremental world backups powered by Git.

You can then go back and retrieve your lost items. The mod will remember your inventory layout and put everything back to where it was before you died. The mod is highly configurable. In fact, if you think a config is missing that has anything to do with what happens when you die, it's not refered to as a missing feature, but a bug. (Not really but that's how serious I am about everything being configurable). \n\n \n\nIf you play multiplayer you'll have no trouble finding which grave is yours, as both your face and player name will render on it (if you've enabled it in the config of course)\n\n \n\n## Features\n\nThe mod is available for 1.16.5, 1.17.1, and 1.18!\n\nAs 1.18 is the newest version of minecraft, 1.18 will be the version most updates are pushed to. This is why you will often find more features in this version than the other versions. However once in a while the 1.16.5 and 1.17.1 will be backported from the newest version. Any issues found with earlier versions will also be handled.\n\nThe mod aims to be compatible with most, if not all inventory mods. Currently You're in Grave Danger provides compat for: inventorio [all versions], trinkets [all versions], curios [1.16], travelers backpack [1.16, 1.17]\n\nOther inventory mods are also compatible with this mod, including backslot, extra inventory and BigInv. The mod will also work with infinitory, however that compatibility is not well tested. If any of the listed mods would not be compatible, or you know another mod affecting the inventory, please open an issue in the mod github repository, or report it in the discord server.\n\nThe mod is technically compatible with every soulbound enchantment, since you can configure which enchantments should not be dropped on death in your grave, and which you should as well keep in your inventory when you respawn. \n\nGraves can be waterlogged, and renders can be adapted to the block the grave is standing on.\n\nGraves can be completely customized with resource packs in all versions. They will affect block hitbox, render parts, the grave skull and grave text. \n\nMore features are also provided, however some of these are disabled by default as most people probably don't want these issues as a part of the mod. \n\n## Misc info\n\nIf you find any bug/missing config, or have a cool idea that would fit in the theme of the mod, please open an issue on the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/B1n-ry/Youre-in-grave-danger/issues)\n\nThe mod is under MIT license, so feel free to use this in your modpack!\n\nThis mod is required both on client and server, as it will add custom blocks and renderers.\n\n\nWant more info about how to configure the mod for modpacks and servers or similar?

This mod is handy for those skyblock experiences we all know and love.\n\nEx Nihilo: Sequentia started as a port of Ex Nihilo: Creatio for 1.12, which in turn was a fork of Ex Nihilo: Adscensio for 1.10, which was a continuation of Ex Nihilo for 1.7.10. Since its start, Ex Nihilo: Sequentia has grown into a familiar yet unique mod of its own.  \n\n## **Beginning with Version 5.0.0 (Minecraft Version 1.20.1), Ex Nihilo: Sequentia will only support NeoForge. Version 4.2.X (Minecraft Version 1.19.X) will continue to be supported until Minecraft Version 1.21 is released, at which point Minecraft 1.19.X, and consequentially Minecraft Forge, will no longer be supported.**  \n\n# Add-ons\n\nBe sure to check out the add-ons for Ex Nihilo: Sequentia!\n\n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ex-nihilo-sequentia-ae2-addon)\n- [Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ex-nihilo-sequentia-mekanism-addon)\n- [Thermal Series](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ex-nihilo-sequentia-thermal-addon)\n\n# Wiki\n\nThe [wiki](novamachina-mods.github.io) will have the most up-to-date information about Ex Nihilo: Sequentia.\n\nCheck out [Discussions](https://github.com/NovaMachina-Mods/ExNihiloSequentia/discussions) on GitHub.\n\n# Issues\n\nIf you find an issue or a bug, please report it on [GitHub](https://github.com/NovaMachina-Mods/ExNihiloSequentia/issues).\n\n# Community\n\nJoin our friendly community to get help for Ex Nihilo: Sequentia and other add-ons and chat with the rest of the players!

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Integration\" - all of the compatibility materials, recipes, and enhancements to make the Thermal Series play even better alongside some common - and not so common - mods. The goal is to blend both style and functionality without compromising or unbalancing the larger modded ecosystem, so config options are in place to quickly disable entire feature sets.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options.\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16]https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

Black-/Whitelisting\n  - Three redstone modes (ignore/on when powered/off when powered)\n  - Four distribution modes (round robin/nearest first/furthest first/random)\n  - Tag filtering\n  - Item/Fluid/Gas filtering\n  - Multiple filters at once\n  - Configurable destinations for each filter\n  - Blacklisting/Inverting of individual filters\n  - Copyable filters\n  - Custom NBT data\n  - Three NBT matching modes (match exact/match existing/match none)\n- Five upgrade tiers\n  - Basic\n  - Improved\n  - Advanced\n  - Ultimate\n  - Infinity (Not craftable by default)\n- Fully customizable transfer speeds\n- Disconnectable with wrenches\n- Extremely lag friendly\n  - **Only extracting pipes have block entities**\n  - Pipes don't load unnecessary chunks\n  - Server friendly\n  - Efficient rendering\n\n## Configuring Pipes\n\n**Pipes don't transfer anything if they are not set to extract.**\nYou can sneak-click onto the end of a connected pipe with a wrench to set it to extract.\n\nClick the extracting part of the pipe to change modes, add filters or add upgrades.\n\nPipes can be disconnected/reconnected by sneak-clicking with a wrench.\n\nBy default pipes are relatively slow. The speed can only be increased by adding an upgrade.\nHigher tiers of upgrades mean a higher transfer rate.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/RknAMZ8BPsAX73SCj9/giphy.gif)\n\nCertain features of pipes can only be used by adding a high enough upgrade:\n\n- Basic Upgrade\n  - Redstone modes\n- Improved Upgrade\n  - Distribution modes\n- Advanced Upgrade\n  - Filter modes\n  - Filters\n  \nEvery configuration you change and every filter you add is stored in the upgrade.\nYou can copy the data to other upgrades by crafting them together.\n\n### Filters\n\nFilters can be used with item pipes, fluid pipes and gas pipes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cO7Hr4Y.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ThD0ou1.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sFDCKEa.png)\n\nTo add a specific item, just click it on the slot in the filter GUI.\nAlternatively you can type the item ID in the text field next to it.\n\nIf the object you inserted had NBT data, the NBT string will be displayed in the second text area.\nYou can remove the NBT text if you don't want to match NBT tags.\n\nThere is also an option to only match the provided NBT data (Button with NBT on it).\nThis can be set to exact mode.\nThis causes only items that match that tag exactly to be accepted by the filter.\n\nFilters can be inverted by pressing the button with the paper on it.\nThis causes the filter to apply for the exact opposite of the provided data (except the destination).\n\nYou can also set the filter to only apply for a certain destination.\nFor this you need a filter destination tool.\nJust click the block your pipe inserts into with it so store the location and face of the block.\nNote that this doesn't work if you clicked a side of the block that the cable isn't connected to.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/TpGoZ3sLyuDXU9B5re/giphy.gif)\n\nTo set the location to a filter, put it into the destination slot of the filter GUI.\nThis will also display the destination block in the filter list.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N5T9HWR.png)\n\nThe **Universal Pipe** has every feature of all other pipes combined.\nYou can choose which pipe type you want to configure with the tabs on the left of the GUI.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0IXNja8.png)\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\nComparison between Pipez' item pipes and Mekanism's logistical transporters with about 4200 pipes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/t6iJe4H.png)\n\n\nComparison between Pipez' item pipes and Mekanism's logistical transporters with about 7200 pipes.\nSince Mekanism calculates its pipe connections with a recursive algorithm it just crashes, due to a stack overflow.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QTzFnqz.png)","published":"2022-06-23T14:27:45.850194Z","updated":"2024-04-28T09:46:06.707392Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":13692,"followers":31,"categories":["technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["aC3cJ0fh","6yc5cqZw","UmaboTnl","kw04LbVp","SOahOqbQ","GVLDDdFo","upYAiTBs","ckGVJofr","SObtpWjU","k3iwaGkl","DwzhRar9","bTP0Gcr2","vsQE1wOP","cyEh972U","cIaZ9rRS","NN7UIB6w","yPOYhpoq","Za0xttH4","s0EI99bm","MAxDsge1","hfFRNG0S","feNhdtCK","aDdqwc1n","8kMppL6r","LuQ50my0","wSZAijjN","Y1scyFIP","4rehD9gy","XkJU0Iyv","du0Qap4T","RioP75Yi","SXr9Kp83","s9VOjEcE","Xmli0WbS","FeZXPOCS","pHdqF72w","YLJMscng","7CiKk8Zh","rQsanX4x","LDgTzWk6","YdixClts","NsmkdRsl","9UEmF7FJ","VR3w5OvL","hrmdRMZI","DAMt6cki","84dGRYVm","zXFR4f1f","8EQVMftD","nL1RM1Ar","bJCRVoNQ","VMY2KByw","GK9d8S87","4tOUJlen","ffhUXzN9","UQtWZdHU","YnQDfluX","NGaUJ4iU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRmWy6ga/be55098fe4886146924fd873e88169c10bf47051.png"},"version":{"id":"ffhUXzN9","project_id":"iRmWy6ga","author_id":"mqxuCPbU","featured":false,"name":"[FORGE][1.20.1]

No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about **63 inventory slots** and **2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 7 buckets of fluid or even 28 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer** to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be **upgraded** to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a **smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset backpack upgrades and settings, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios/Trinkets integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nCrafting Table is your bestfriend? Equip your backpack with Crafting Upgrade! Unroll the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8wR8Thg.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/c9Ojonb.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fmjcSej.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/np93li4.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

(A new take on the Builder's Wand)","body":"# Construction Wand\n\nWith a Construction Wand you can place multiple blocks (up to 1024) at once, extending your build on the side you're\nfacing. If that's not enough: you can upgrade your wand with additional cores, allowing you to place a block behind the\nblock you are facing, conjure blocks in mid air or destroy lots of blocks very fast.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/images/c9dc4b40da63d535f90020335804e089addb5896.png)\n\n**Note:** These are the instructions for ConstructionWand version 2.0+, which introduced some new features.\nIf you are still using version 1.x, refer to [those](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/tree/1.16.2-1.7)\ninstructions.\n\n## Wands\n\nThere are basic wands made from stone, iron and diamond and the Infinity wand. Wands from higher tiers are more powerful\nand last longer. These properties can be changed in the config.\n\n| Wand     | Durability  | Max. Blocks | Upgradeable | Angel distance | Max. Blocks (Destroy) |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Stone    | 131         | 9           | No          | -              | -                     |\n| Iron     | 250         | 27          | Yes         | 1              | 9                     |\n| Diamond  | 1561        | 128         | Yes         | 4              | 25                    |\n| Infinity | Unbreakable | 1024        | Yes         | 8              | 81                    |\n\n## Crafting\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting1.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting2.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting3.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting4.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting5.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting6.png)\n\n## Keybindings\n\nTo change a wand's core and options or undo your placement you need to hold down the wand option key\n(refered as OPTKEY). By default, this is CTRL, but it can be changed in the client config file. To prevent unwanted\nchanges to your options, you can configure that you have to hold down SNEAK as well to change options or open up the\nGUI.\n\n## Wand cores\n\nWand cores are magical gemstones that make your wand do its thing.\n\nEvery wand comes with a Construction core. You can make your wand even better by putting\naditional cores into it. Put your new core together with your wand in a\ncrafting grid to install it. To switch between cores, hold down OPTKEY and left click empty space\nwith your wand.\nStone wands can't be upgraded.\n\n**Construction core**\n\nExtend your build on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nHold down OPTKEY and scroll to change placement restriction\n(Horizontal, Vertical, North/South, East/West, No lock).\n\n**Angel core**\n\nPlace a block on the opposite side of the block (or row of blocks) you are facing. Maximum distance depends\non wand tier. Right click empty space to place a block in midair (similar to angel blocks, hence the name).\nTo do that, you'll need to have the block you want to place in your offhand. You can't place a block in midair\nif you've fallen more than 10 blocks deep (no easy rescue tool from falling into the void).\n\n**Destruction core**\n\nDestroy blocks (no tile entities) on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nRestrictions work just like with the Construction core. Destroyed blocks disappear into the void,\nyou can use the undo feature if you've made a mistake.\n\n## Options\nSNEAK+OPTKEY+Right clicking empty space opens the option screen of your wand.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/options.png)\n\n**Restriction:** If restriction is enabled the wand will only place blocks in one row or column\n(choose between North/South, East/West on a horizontal plane and Horizontal, Vertical on a vertical plane).\nIf the direction lock is switched off, the wand will extend the entire face of the building it's pointed at. This option\nhas no effect if the angel core is enabled.\n\n**Direction:** If set to \"Player\" the wand places blocks in the same direction as if they were placed by yourself.\nTarget mode places the blocks in the same direction as their supporting block. See the picture below:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/placedir.png)\n\n**Replacement:** Enables/disables the replacement of replaceable blocks (Fluids, snow, tallgrass).\n\n**Matching:** Select which blocks are extended by the wand. If set to \"EXACT\" it will only extend blocks that\nare exactly the same as the selected block.<br>\n\"SIMILAR\" will treat similar blocks equally (e.g. extend dirt and grass blocks).<br>\n\"ANY\" will extend any block on the face of the building you're looking at.\n\n**Random:** If random mode is enabled, the wand places random blocks from your hotbar.<br>\n~~Shamelessly stolen~~ Inspired by the Trowel from Quark.\n\n## Undo\n\nHolding down Sneak+OPTKEY while looking at a block will show you the last blocks you placed with a green border around\nthem. Sneak+OPTKEY+Right clicking any of them will undo the operation, giving you all the items back. If you used the\nDestruction core, it will restore the blocks.\n\n## Additional features\n\n- Shulker boxes, bundles (MC 1.17+) and many containers from other mods can provide building blocks for the wand\n\n- Botania compatibility: The Black Hole Talisman can supply blocks just like shulker boxes can. Having a Rod of the\n  Lands / Rod of the Depths in your inventory will provide you with infinite dirt/cobble at the cost of Mana.\n\n- Having blocks in your offhand will place them instead of the block you're looking at\n\n- Look at your statisics to see how many blocks you have placed using your wand\n\n- **1.16+ only:** The Infinity Wand won't burn in lava just like netherite gear.\n\n- Ingame documentation with Just Enough Items (JEI)\n\n## TileEntity Blacklist\n\nSome modded TileEntitys can cause issues when placed using a wand. They may turn into invisible and\nunremovable ghost blocks, become unbreakable or cause other unwanted effects.\n\nThat's why I've included a Black/Whitelist system\nfor TileEntities in CW Version 1.7. Chisels&Bits blocks are blacklisted by default.\nThere are probably a few other tile entities from other mods out there which may cause issues as well.\nIf you find some of them you can tell me by creating\nan issue, commenting on Curse or editing the default blacklist yourself\n(it is located at https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/blob/1.19/src/main/java/thetadev/constructionwand/basics/ConfigServer.java#L25)\nand making a

standards of quality, and top tier optimisation. It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

Adds Thermal-style tools and equipment!\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Innovation\" - a collection of things which increase player-centric power - useful tools, gadgets, and armor.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features.

If you want to disable BlockItem(s), let your block implement&nbsp;INoItemBlock, ICustomBlockItem, or&nbsp;ICreativeTabBlock, depending on what you want to achieve.</li>\n<li>For&nbsp;BlockEntity rendering, custom BlockEntityType constants may have additional @TileRenderer, pointing to an&nbsp;IBESR&lt;Tile&gt; class.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Old-styled language parsers in format of \"key=value\", instead of JSONs (the file names and format is like in older game versions, but you need to call LanguageAdapter.registerMod(MOD_ID); inside your mod's constructor for it to register.</li>\n<li>Mod Source checks, that allow you to check if the mod was downloaded from adware/malware sites, AND warn users about it.</li>\n<li>Java-based recipe registration with a simple&nbsp;RegisterRecipesEvent, that runs on HammerLib.EVENT_BUS, allowing you, as a developer, to register crafting recipes like before, with code.</li>\n<li>Java-based tag population, with&nbsp;BuildTagsEvent, that runs on HammerLib.EVENT_BUS.</li>\n<li>Vastly simplified networking, using Network class, and IPacket + INBTPacket to allow for flawless and intuitive packet code development.</li>\n<li>Wrappers for block harvesting, that has been moved over to tags - BlockHarvestAdapter</li>\n<li>Field-based NBT serialization, so that you don't make a typo/forget to write serialization/deserialization code.</li>\n<li>Good old TileEntity wrappers, with TileSyncable and TileSyncableTickable, that allow synchronization of initial state, as well as registering properties that will be synchronized independently.</li>\n<li>ContainerAPI for BlockEntities, allowing to avoid MenuType&lt;?&gt; altogether (no need to register screen providers, menu types etc)</li>\n<li>ItemStack -&gt; Color[] API, with&nbsp;TexturePixelGetter.getAllColors</li>\n<li>Annotation-based custom model loaders (@LoadUnbakedGeometry on IUnbakedGeometry&lt;SELF&gt;), avoids using the geometry loader class by making a common wrapper.</li>\n<li>...And a whole lot more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And a lot of rich features for mod devs.</p>\n<p><strong>Not enough?

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

This can be changed to a number of different configurations using the config, which can be found in `config/chunkanimator-client.toml` relative to the Minecraft directory. For more information on these options, see [the Wiki page](https://github.com/Harleyoc1/ChunkAnimator/wiki/Config).\n\n## OptiFine\nOptiFine is supported, however for the chunks to be animated you will need to make sure the `render regions` option is disabled (set to `false`).

PFD is based around the axiom that \"If you were to distill Minecraft to its essence, it would be the moment of gratification when a build is finished and you feel proud of yourself for having built it\".\n\nFor example, the image above shows off the Quark Oddities Copper Pipes. These pipes are purposely designed to work in an intuitive fashion, but still low to the ground in pathing and \"smart\" logic. This ensures that pipes are usable for large contraptions, while still being a challenge to do so, and providing that awesome moment when you finish your build.\n\nOddities is a \"pseudoaddon\", which means all the code for it is actually in Quark itself, and the Oddities jar serves only as a user friendly way to install the module and filter packs with it.

Tree is an ancient immortal transcendental being that manifests himself in the shape of an ordinary oak tree\n\nYou might also notice its uncanny human resemblance, this is because he can engage in complex methaphyical conversation with the player  \nTo do so simply touch him\n\n- Be wary tho as attacking the tree wont be a good idea as he can very well defend for himself. Infact how could have he lived for so long if he didnt?\n\n- Once talked to the tree will bestow the player with all sorts of his knowledge such as random facts, words of wistom, trivia or even jokes.\n\nTo do so however you will first have to gain hist trust by talking with him for long enough.  \nNegative actions will of course decrease his trust in you\n\n- Pro tip: don't talk to him during the day as doing so will require you to wake him up and this will reduce his trust in you\n\n- As for where you can find him there's not a good answer as he is the one that will find you but in general be on the lookout becaus this might very well happen in any overworld biome.

Please report any bugs with Beta 2.x.x to [Thaumon's github issues page](https://github.com/shizotoaster/thaumon/issues)\n\n### *A Thaumon is a subatomic particle of magic*\n\n**Thaumon** is a decoration mod inspired by the blocks and textures of Thaumcraft. It adds Greatwood, Silverwood, Arcane Stone, and Eldritch Stone building materials, as well as a few Amber blocks. To get started, make some Mutagen by breaking down a block of amethyst in a stonecutter.\n\nTextures are all original *(largely edits of vanilla textures because I'm not that great of an artist)* and unrelated to any Thaumcraft assets in everything except name.\n\nWhen Thaumcraft 7 releases, this mod will likely become obsolete.\n\nThaumon 1.0.x is made with MCreator\\\n~~This mod was created using *MCreator*. If that bothers you, it probably should! That's okay though - there are no functional objects here besides doors and such, everything is simply a decorative block. There should be no issues arising from MCreator's dubious generated code.~~\n\n*This mod was created on a whim after hearing the comments of a user in the CoFH Discord server lamenting the lack of Thaumcraft palette blocks in modern Minecraft. I joked that I would happily do it...in MCreator. Surprisingly, they were cool with that.*\n\n### Contributors\nSpecial thanks to\n- [Exelerium](https://modrinth.com/user/Exelerium) for Russian translation.

but it requires Terrablender, which screws with the biome distribution\n- Terralith is compatible with Tectonic, if you use [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloDatapacks)'s [Terratonic](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terratonic/)\n- Do not add this to an existing world - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nTerralith adds over 95 brand new biomes, as well as updating almost every vanilla biome with new and improved features. There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-12-08T18:45:45.608403Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":813258,"followers":1600,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL","4KrRTVvQ","WgDuoe1K","xm11wemG","FgvUosFH","zA1qYB0L","6DoFR4md"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"FgvUosFH","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.4.11 ~ 1.20.2","version_number":"2.4.11","changelog":"This is for ALL modloaders 1.20-1.20.2.\n\n# Terralith 2.4.11\n- Emergency hotfix: prevent crash regarding \"regular structure set\"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-08T01:10:08.715317Z","downloads":297961,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ac529b2a6ab9189cc6b6b459fa7b7b85f6e230e4","sha512":"b6bd6e71666dd57e1db19fe7cad85a9e0d9a13a9c6fa839c4e9cb149b12cf855f8f1676c4bc4d9647f1ba32a7a4f40d3f7090de3c5ddd569950c408b8cfd9128"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/FgvUosFH/Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar","primary":true,"size":2478785,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar"},"mods\\DarkPaintings-Forge-1.20.1-17.0.4.jar":{"sha512":"7b86af1252a330d592fde952d7154f9f6667f42a92ea3ffd6aca7df6d0a23d4397b42661025008640eac3ec141f8906a08443d59ebe8eb65e657ef604b7a4caf","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lFGQ4Hnk","slug":"dark-paintings","project_type":"mod","team":"z6lDOPqq","title":"Dark Paintings","description":"Adds new paintings to Minecraft","body":"<p>This mod adds a large variety of new paintings to the game.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-04-02T17:28:47.694321Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1343318,"followers":1626,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"stb5nE30","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.1

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Dynamics\" - containing ducts which allow for transport of Energy and Fluids across distances great and small, as well as additional logistical blocks related to transport.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options (1.18.2 only).\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their Discord. I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods if you would like to discuss, provide suggestions, etc.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nGenerally Embeddium should work out of the box with many more mods than Rubidium. However, given the scope of changes\nit makes to the renderer, it may have compatibility issues with some mods that use advanced rendering. Please open an\nissue if you experience problems. Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it. I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n* CelestialAbyss and input-Here for making the new logo design\n\n## License\n\nEmbeddium, like Sodium, is licensed under

required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

In simpler terms, it's a large mod with lots of small features, aimed at improving the vanilla game. \nEvery feature can be turned on and off individually at your will, and most features contain further options to tweak the game just how you like it.\n\nWith quark installed, the title screen will get a new \"q\" button added to it. This button allows you to configure quark from inside the game, so you can easily turn off any features you don't vibe with.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\nQuark has over a hundred different modules to play with, but here's a small highlight reel of our favorites:\n\n* Feeding Trough, for automatic animal breeding\n* Pistons Push Tile Entities, just like in Bedrock Edition\n* Japanese and Industrial style building blocks\n* Variant versions for Bookshelves, Chests, and Ladders for all wood types\n* Vertical Slabs, for all slabs already in the base game and Quark\n* Advanced Camera Mode for fancy screenshots\n* Toretoises, typo intended - new underground animals that grow ore on their back\n* Pickarang, a pickaxe that can be thrown as a boomerang\n* Trowel, a new tool to place random blocks from your hotbar, for paths or ruins\n* Emote system, allowing your character to do all sorts of motions from the chat menu\n* Reacharound Placing, which lets you place blocks under other blocks without being able to see the bottom face\n* Azalea Wood, replacing the Oak wood in Azalea trees with a pleasant green\n* Glimmering Weald, a new rare deep underground biome with glowing mushrooms and a cute new stone fae mob\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Quark today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://quarkmod.net/)**\n\n* Visit the [Old Website](https://quarkmod.net/old) (for Minecraft versions 1.12 and prior)\n* Check out [what changed](https://vazkii.notion.site/Quark-3-0-Forge-1-18-Release-Notes-f22ef705b677421585f1208156a82b44) between Quark for 1.16 and Quark for 1.18\n* Download [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), an addon focusing on more complex and technical features\n\n---\n\n# Compatibility\n\nQuark has built-in compatibility for a few mods, including JEI and TerraBlender.\n\nQuark may be incompatible with Optifine. If you are having issues using the two together, please uninstall Optifine and use a Sodium fork instead. \n\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing load crashes on 1.20.1, make sure your other mods are up to date, as any mods with integration from older versions will not function until updated.\n\n---\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T03:56:40.716482Z","updated":"2024-04-15T06:00:44.281099Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":331627,"followers":476,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["hUHoJ8IU","DWIopZ9p","z07wlDPM","MPJKDJmI","etJaVjwR","LQATRjJy","WVcMK697","e4xifKGM","NBd2DS3z","aLMcsDgH","KnCaeyy6","dNfuCJua","LrasAC1d","kDj0Fa7f","ywSMRT9e","kYMyxgpY","JThLxL7g","L9PRqT3G","Y5dUVG07","jchiLv3T","J2ikYge8","hxZ3rlaJ","4JhlPAZH","kGwG7wZ9","XV6IcdSU","ieBJd6v7","lYGV9kJO","NRZpkg7a","c7hTFL3Q","Nhn8Fatv","9ihQgCxD","qNOl7hL2","JXifdD4Q","SabfrHOJ","Vjf1btuB","8B3wEsDO","zyvZoGBo","l56EicrO","QipVljYx","htdpIhCQ","stYFI7Km","Bz5rycUV","2y7uLplb","nYJW7kfd","mxjAPHWr","ZqUi5HxP","M1mbFwiX","8po5DGR8","aKj03FLO","1d9CRYwK","sLfwgQ44","233kpcpB","a8AI08wJ","2u6IMNar","oTVxvQ9o","4vXzGj8g","85thgL6V"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/64151f8964bc6b81d968e814bf7344bbdfad27d0.png"},"version":{"id":"85thgL6V","project_id":"qnQsVE2z","author_id":"kRXgk5E1","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-4.0-441","version_number":"1.20.1-4.0-441","changelog":"https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/releases/tag/release-1.20.1-4.0-441","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-15T06:00:45.868541Z","downloads":6835,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8d77be1895584535700397f4c909ec3959941f67","sha512":"4cb23c24b56fafce47efa36c75a3a4ca1ebd17d16c37b72a5f8cd2d73998c61dc5e613acb03c89183529b92ff06a4bfb2e9a9a495247123be43165a2f3f403e7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/versions/85thgL6V/Quark-4.0-441.jar","filename":"Quark-4.0-441.jar","primary":true,"size":14733403,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"MVARlG2f","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"IV1Ji8se","username":"quat","name":"quaternary","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2068021?v=4","bio":"Dragon","created":"2020-12-24T00:27:44.019284Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"nxIuTMRv","username":"GoesBySully","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/nxIuTMRv/f4400aa9bc0120732ae57903fab324e986e726f7.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T12:53:22.188525Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"W53r0fU4","username":"Siuolplex","name":"Siuol","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43890828?v=4","bio":"","created":"2020-11-21T03:51:29.493313Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco Lavos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794735?v=4","bio":"holy hell","created":"2022-11-13T03:09:41.900759Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"2pSgrUlO","username":"IThundxr","name":"IThundxr","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74031881?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-14T19:41:15.163217Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Quark-4.0-441.jar"},"mods\\SolarFluxReborn-1.20.1-20.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"81d30ad4a9073fd5c4c3ce8212c095545912b2d51a4660d4697e4dbe35c7e8b6fd7ed89990db68f4af8b4b347dccae0b293a179668a690722b201adbbdbcee91","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4QG5lev4","slug":"solar-flux-reborn","project_type":"mod","team":"sMt0u0U6","title":"Solar Flux Reborn","description":"Adding solar panels into Minecraft.

[Applied Energistics 2][ae2] providing higher tiers of storage, ranging in capacity from 1M to as high as 256M, similarly to add-ons of old such as Extra Cells 2 and its successors.\n\nUnlike conventional add-ons in the same vein, MEGA does things quite differently, featuring its own dedicated progression line and components to further augment and challenge existing AE2 players' set-ups, while emphasising a distinct visual style with jet-black colour schemes.\n\n## ![Features][header_features]\n- **1M - 256M** item and fluid cells (standard + portable)\n- MEGA **Crafting CPUs** with bespoke all-black crafting units: 1M - 256M storage, 4-threaded co-processing unit and matching monitor\n- Integration with multiple other AE2 add-ons such as [Applied Mekanistics][appmek] (1-256M chemical cells) and [Applied Botanics][appbot] (1-256M mana cells)\n- **MEGA Bulk Item Storage Cell**: Designed for infinite storage of a single item type\n- **Bulk Compression**: Automatic conversion between ingots, nuggets and blocks for bulk item cell storage, with full support for auto-crafting via the **Decompression Module**\n- **MEGA Pattern Provider**: Double-capacity storage for processing patterns\n- **Superdense Energy Cell** and **Greater Energy Card**: Increased energy storage for AE networks and portable devices\n\n...and more still to come.\n\n## ![License][header_license]\nAll

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

On","description":"Carry On allows you to pick up Tile Entities and Mobs and carry them around!","body":"Ever wonder why you can carry a stack of 64 empty chests in your pocket, but you can’t move a filled one with your bare hands? Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":612794,"followers":730,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"edGQD16r","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:28.090790Z","downloads":99250,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"4f75afb703dd71c322d4e2e27d28d7ab4afeb0c242bcee6d1eb5fef59ee4347352f1ca55f1826743957d2e95a951ed13884356485b0a979b14010915079e2c29","sha1":"9999714ca3dd2f2401f0396ca44f3b27c3784c4f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/edGQD16r/carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":439457,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\storagedrawers-1.20.1-12.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"294f171c77478a91f009b83fb8f93ebf21ced13d6df2589e5ee45bb86aebb1fd137198feb91c00dbba28309fe4832398bfe4b51870310a8e5f701c99a603af6b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"guitPqEi","slug":"storagedrawers","project_type":"mod","team":"l2DUk76U","title":"Storage Drawers","description":"Official distribution of the Storage Drawers mod for Minecraft Forge","body":"Put your most frequently used items within convenient reach. Storage Drawers borrows ideas from Jabba and Bibliocraft, resulting in a highly functional, compact, and aesthetic storage solution that is meant to complement rather than replace those mods.\n\nUsage\n\nThere is no traditional slotted inventory with these containers. Interaction is click-based similar to Jabba. Clicking on one of drawers on front will interact with that drawer.\n\n* Right-Click: Insert full stack in hand into drawer (or partial stack if the drawer fills).\n* Double-Right-Click: Insert all compatible stacks in inventory into drawer (or until drawer fills).\n* Left-Click: Remove a single item from the drawer.\n* Shift+Left-Click: Remove a full stack from the drawer.\n* Shift+Right-Click with empty hand: Open a UI to see exact item counts and manage applied upgrades.\n\nThe shift-click behavior is reversed from Jabba. This is based on the theory that you normally interact with stacks in Jabba, but will want to normally interact with single items in Storage Drawers. The controls can be reversed in the mod config to match Jabba.","published":"2024-03-02T20:21:13.894811Z","updated":"2024-03-06T04:17:23.769095Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":17770,"followers":21,"categories":["storage"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["HxmL9PcX","jBDpKNQU","FAzvjZqP","2mnDY1lv","KHeT8f2m","SyIcJHJD","xLf7BhhH","ACS10DVh","4Gl4Ciq0","OFLFaoSI","n9D7LOsG","WJsQWqRL","qvYg0XZY","JrW72m02","x8IjhUYB","zpJRdLGW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/guitPqEi/58b4229c52876eff66c9f98a5d2a1e9b9f648501.png"},"version":{"id":"HxmL9PcX","project_id":"guitPqEi","author_id":"CjGInQcu","featured":true,"name":"Storage Drawers 1.20.1-12.0.3","version_number":"12.0.3","changelog":"Latest 1.20.x release, bringing to Modrinth","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-02T20:35:09.284114Z","downloads":10941,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"294f171c77478a91f009b83fb8f93ebf21ced13d6df2589e5ee45bb86aebb1fd137198feb91c00dbba28309fe4832398bfe4b51870310a8e5f701c99a603af6b","sha1":"ea5d343239fddf815ad44bee5a2d0dc2503f9cfb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/guitPqEi/versions/HxmL9PcX/storagedrawers-1.20.1-12.0.3.jar","filename":"storagedrawers-1.20.1-12.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":583143,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"l2DUk76U","user":{"id":"CjGInQcu","username":"Texelsaur","name":"jaquadro@gmail.com","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CjGInQcu/12f007de1ea1dd12c6a768a6462b72706ff25807.png","bio":null,"created":"2024-03-02T20:16:08.481830Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"storagedrawers-1.20.1-12.0.3.jar"},"mods\\appliedenergistics2-forge-15.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"82b03def4269d2fe052e09a09e7774c10d2889982ac5caa2b7976181ebf784830529febab435847e2966d2ba0bcdd5e0f6d39c831aa7b461809563ff13bd4ef2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XxWD5pD3","slug":"ae2","project_type":"mod","team":"CqWdb4w5","title":"Applied Energistics 2","description":"AE2: A popular automation and storage mod","body":"Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) is a comprehensive mod for Minecraft that introduces a unique approach to in-game inventory management. It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-04-28T12:55:40.932447Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":431240,"followers":507,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"isHbiIeZ","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":true,"name":"AE2

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own

Villagers","description":"Village Pest Control","body":"Are you tired of your village dying off because its golem is too lazy?\n\nAre you tired of essentially defending it all by yourself?\n\nThis mod adds Guards as a solution, as well as new villager-related AI changes.\n\nAn * means a feature is configurable\n\n# Guards \nThese spawn in villages in groups of six, equipped with either an iron sword or a crossbow. They're prepared to fight any threat to the village (possibly including you!). To make new guards, crouch + right click on a nitwit or unemployed villager with a sword or crossbow.\n\nGuards can 'gossip' with villagers and will trust the player to open their inventory if they have a high enough reputation, have hero of the village, or is created by the player. Right clicking will open up the guard inventory, allowing you to give them armor, and swap out their weapons! For their offhand slot, you can either give them a shield, or some food. If they have a shield, they will use it to block attacks. Crossbow guards with a shield won't be able to kick enemies if they're blocking. If they have food (or a potion), they will start eating or drinking if they are low on health. Clicking the patrol button will allow you to set patrol points for guards, melee guards will walk around the point while ranged guards will snipe enemies and stand still on their point.\n\nIf you have hero of the village, they will gain the ability to follow and fight for you when you click the follow button.\n![Guard](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/images/0b0df1486eb77f265e6aef5b619288a83b548bb0.png)\n\n\n\n \n\n# AI Changes\nWitches attack villagers. *true by default \n\n\n\nIn raids, illagers kill any animal they see. *false by default \n\nVillagers and Illagers are scared of polar bears. *true by default \n\nClerics heal low-health guards, villagers, and players with Hero of the Village using regeneration potions, and smiths repair iron golems with ingots.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\nCan you port to an older version/fabric?\n\nNo. Maintaining one version is hard enough already, and I've never learned fabric. However, the mod's license permits you to make ports yourself. A fabric version of this mod also currently exists.\n\nCan you port to Windows 10 Edition/Xbox/Mobile?\n\nNo. Mods for the Bedrock ediiton use a completely different framework that I've also never learned. The mod's license allows you to try yourself, but since the modding API on Bedrock is less capable than forge you probably won't be able to replicate all of it.\n\nWhy don't guards have a workstation like other villager professions?\n\nI haven't thought of a suitable block that would let you have a large number of guards without being inconvenient to store.\n\nHow would you make guards spawn with modded equipment?\n\nYou can make them spawn with modded equipment by making a datapack that overrides the guard_chestplate, guard_helmet, guard_legs, guard feet, guard_main_hand or guard_off_hand json files. \n\nIs this mod compatible with X?\n\nTry and see!\n\n \n\n Special thanks to those in the MMD discord for helping me with some of the mods contents.","published":"2022-09-03T23:22:15.287365Z","updated":"2024-04-28T02:37:36.797259Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":107104,"followers":148,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["pBMhXHpy","FDyptF3C","h74EaSxg","tgvSxMbz","m5FPm7qd","VKAaGaUt","8FhU0wlh","CuWQRWRh","ZkNhijwC","d6rBM4Cg","FJBvRpmS","cwxNfyOe","F2iGn9UV","a6unnpep","V3WwPGO0","e2O5TKqU","APAV3nRX","HaGxOuRA","MUAGK1gz","wXjGQwVf","bhwMZR6g","ZXYzy1iR","7XuY8OQc","dYJvXrpF","kKMVQLRQ","C2Kx5KoF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/de6a0dca1d4d1f1e1c97409b51683cc7348797a6.png"},"version":{"id":"C2Kx5KoF","project_id":"H1sntfo8","author_id":"9vwtx5vp","featured":false,"name":"Guard Villagers 1.20.1-1.6.5","version_number":"1.20.1-1.6.5","changelog":"\n\n    Added Komodo Dragon (Alexs Mobs) to mob blacklist\n    Added separate config option for mobs attacking guards\n    Adjusted range of Crossbow guards firing arrows\n    Made iron golems float and walk back to nearest land when in water\n    Fixed guards not returning back to checkpoint\n    Added advancement to recruiting a guard\n    Made guards not attack zombified piglins\n    Enabled illagers attacking animals during raids by default\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-28T02:37:37.339910Z","downloads":542,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"85299573c77d32abb7134a59ddd97fab323933b8","sha512":"7fa47b80825c682efcc35e5f5e01cf3e05bd62ac055f904969add89dbfcd65f463c40766ad3415e68fc3a40154d710f0dd2e6436625087de05200e2a1762e922"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/versions/C2Kx5KoF/guardvillagers-1.20.1-1.6.5.jar","filename":"guardvillagers-1.20.1-1.6.5.jar","primary":true,"size":203546,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DgYRJUTF","user":{"id":"9vwtx5vp","username":"seymourimadeit","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965249?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T05:53:33.697802Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"guardvillagers-1.20.1-1.6.5.jar"},"mods\\lambdynamiclights-2.3.1+1.19.4.jar":{"sha512":"36367444be19ba28c5f6a8907d50eb172a5228f1b240f318a806ee15b03a9d6913b5335537200285ce1a5fbf6dd89e5399db6d6256bb9f45d17c26d431cc7c75","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yBW8D80W","slug":"lambdynamiclights","project_type":"mod","team":"BEQmFKFk","title":"LambDynamicLights","description":"A dynamic lights mod for Fabric.","body":"# LambDynamicLights\n\n\n[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/LICENSE)\n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n[![Mod loader: Fabric]][fabric] \n\nA dynamic lights mod for Quilt and Fabric.\n\n## 📖 What's this mod?\n\nIt's dark outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft.

Mekanism is an *experience* that will forever change the way you play Minecraft.\n\nHere at Mekanism, Inc., we bring you a suite of low, mid, and high tier machinery to elevate your archaic home and inefficient resource processing to the 21st century. With our collection of high-tech tools, high-end energy generators, advanced transmission systems and intricate processing mechanisms, you’ll find yourself relieved of the tedious tasks of ‘mining’ and ‘crafting’ and quickly progressing to new levels of technological enlightenment.\n\nYou may not realize it, but every time you smelt an ore directly into its respective ingot, you’re wasting the majority of what you’ve mined. Mekanism’s team of experienced chemical and mechanical engineers have developed advanced ore processing machinery to extract resources from ores with utmost efficiency. With our purification, dissolution, chemical injection, and crystallization technologies, you can now double, triple, quadruple, even *quintuple* your ingot production per ore, given enough infrastructure and energy.\n\nOur engineering team understands and embraces gradual technological progression. For whatever stage of gameplay you’ve reached, we offer a tier of machinery to suit your needs. Every Mekanism machine can be upgraded to a factory, allowing you to process, 3 (basic), 5 (advanced), 7 (elite), or even 9 (ultimate) different items at once -- in a single machine! No more are the rows, even *walls* of slow and ugly furnaces that once plagued your home. Condense your machinery infrastructure with Mekanism today.\n\nJust a few of the many reasons Mekanism will be the highlight of your Minecraft experience:\n- Hydrogen-powered **Jetpacks**, with multiple togglable flight modes\n- A small, cute, and loyal robotic friend (**Robit**!) to follow you around\n- A **Digital Miner** with state-of-the-art filtering technologies to automate your mining needs\n- A **Fusion Reactor** which uses advanced [internal confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion) technology to harness the power of the sun to run advanced machinery (*requires Mekanism Generators*)\n- Various transmitters for transferring items, fluids, gases, energy, and even heat!\n- An effective machinery configuration system, which allows for the creation of advanced item transport networks capable of sorting and filtering (using our patented **Logistical Transporters**!)\n\nLinks to other Mekanism modules:\n- [Mekanism Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-additions)\n- [Mekanism Generators](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-generators)\n- [Mekanism Tools](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-tools)\n\n<br>\n\nWe **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** playing Mekanism with CyanideX's Unity: Dark Edition resource pack.\n- [Unity: Dark Edition](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity-dark-edition/)\n- [Classic Unity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity/)","published":"2022-05-27T00:12:09.740488Z","updated":"2024-04-12T21:12:52.283915Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":179027,"followers":259,"categories":["equipment","storage","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["gqJMEABX","wukmoSeF","4QWCUteA","ruRBKgwc","KIzASRO5","dZZ4j18G","4IEoyWzh","IDjtJsDR","ZrS7qENE","nDxFueG2","DlhxRTKL","atcAq1UT","Pz4thLN2","ppz3xziS","g74zfl0m","RGlXXgcD","zWt8Aemn","zLHaraw3","yDOSRo2r","6zqf3EGe","OFopgIFW","xKRR7R7a","RBifwW3R","TAyUJAKw","X58zIngK","CgFgCgTf","yj7d33HE","MLG4wWo6","W5PUUWt9","GxZSvUQi","5fXP0XBe","52nOMLHi","gNIc57RO","eVOeDNA3","aYZg5gr4","ITHqRXF6","H8bgSedJ","JzPscbhA","nKXR4Epk","JorNeGyn","SsMYCLyo","ymNS7Xu4","b6FomViI","294wJ15t","TRHlTRLN","yIGbm770","qb6SolDK","POJlYRhY","L8Ew5o4z","Tk6qda6I"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ce6I4WUE/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"gNIc57RO","project_id":"Ce6I4WUE","author_id":"81DWsUKb","featured":false,"name":"10.4.6.20","version_number":"10.4.6.20","changelog":"<a href=\"https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/f6a6ba94db0f90cd1541f63c3a7d09ceb5a99928\">f6a6ba9</a> -

The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2024-04-27T23:24:43.987405Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":629149,"followers":295,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm","sVuCrC2E","DtYuKcQY","3VUlU5Ga","rAPky5mo","iy9E6HF4","qlWryz6z","MjnZWw5h","fPjcw2f6","anCi5HAr","U8r7nIbi","9hjtlBBI","fAlF6Tqn","nxZSj82i","PeTgKttm","t01OqNOZ","LgpxZ1yG","1aZiIHQO","nRQ4FbAf","UfNitWgy","AQ384Hch","1C6lBZmu","L0Tw2xgL","7Wei6s2K","9ro67WYY","adn5hcLm","TOk3Lved","WHmuOhGH","kKPFv8aa","DmFR6XO3","nJQvdzJp","YGa5gGxr","6EgL0aP4","7UxKaIU0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"7UxKaIU0","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-5.9.0+1.20.1","version_number":"5.9.0+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\nPrior to version 5.2.0, this project used [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

You can also find me on the Minecraft Forge discord server or the Direwolf20 one. Happy chat.\n\n\n## DEPENDENCIES\n\nExtreme Reactor require ZeroCore to work. Please add the correct version to your mod folder.\n\nTo use the in-game manual you need the mod Patchouli in your pack.\n\n\n## THE EXTREME REACTOR API\n\nThe API jar is available on my maven rep: https://maven.zerono.it/\n\n\n## NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE 1.12.2\n\n\n**Turbine Coils update! (versions 2.0.38 and following)**\n\nThere are now three new (one is making its comeback) late/end game coils for extracting a huge amount of power from your Turbines: Ludicrite, Ridiculite and Inanite. You should expect around 45K / 75K / 115K FE/t from a full coil in a Reinforced Turbine from each of them.\n\nMod(-pack) authors can now use the /er coils command to fine tune any new coil they add to ER\n\n\n**The Fluid Fuels update!  (version 1.16.5-2.0.32 / 1.17.1-2.0.32 and following)**\n\nExtreme Reactors now support fuels (and wastes) reactants in fluid form that you can insert in your Reactors without any material loss using the new Fuel Injection Port set in inlet mode. Fluid wastes will be ejected into an Injection Port set in outlet mode.\n\nHow will you make fluid fuels? With a new multiblock machine: the Fluidizer!\n\nYou will need a Controller, a Power Port, an Output Port and the usual mix of Casing and Glass parts (if you like the Glass, right now the fluid is not rendered inside the multiblock). There are two kind of Injector Ports that will let you insert material in the Fluidizer:\n\n- the Fluidizer Solid Injector for solid ingots or blocks\n- the Fluidizer Fluid Injector for liquid fuels\n\nOne Solid Injector will let you convert your solid fuel to it's fluid form\n\nTwo Solid Injectors will let to convert and mix two different solid fuels into a new type of fluid fuel\n\nTwo Fluid Injectors will let you convert and mix two different fluid fuels into a new type of fluid fuel\n\nMixing fuels with usually give you a better fuel than the original ones\n\nPlease check in JEI for the recipes (more recipes can be added using Vanilla recipe system)\n\n- All fuels and wastes in fluid form can be placed in the world. It will be probably not a good idea to swim in them\n\n- Added the Verderium fuel. The top tier fuel\n\n- Added the Rossinite waste. It will make you go fast like the GOAT\n\n- Added /er command (op level 2+). Useful for pack authors to fine tune fuel values\n\n\n**The Fuel Update (version 1.16.5-2.0.29 / 1.17.1-2.0.29 and following)\n\nExtreme Reactors now support fuels reactants that produce fuels with different properties from each other. This allow ER and mods / modpacks to add different kind of fuels using the ER API (FuelProperties / ReactantsRegistry) or the API modpack-wrapper. If no fuel properties are specified for new fuels reactants, the default ones (Yellorium) are used. This will allow the creations of other fuels by mixing existing ones, once liquid fuels are finalized.\n\nBlutonium is back as a full-fledged reactant and fuel, with a better yield than Yellorium (keep in mind that it's properties are not set in stone right now), and it's \"crafted\" by reprocessing Cyanite.\n\nBlutonium will turn into Magentite, a new waste-type reactant, after being used in the Reactor. There is currently no use for it in the mod, but who knows what will happen in the future.\n\n\n**The Reprocessor (version 1.16.5-2.0.29 and following)\n\nA new multiblock machine that's able to reprocess wastes into new fuels. You will use it, for example, to craft Blutonium from Cyanite (check the recipe in JEI).\n\nThe Reprocessor is a 3x3x7 (x/z/y, external dimiensions) multiblock build using Reprocessor Casing blocks for the frame or faces. Reprocessor Glass blocks can be used instead of Casing on the faces. You need one (and only one) of each of the other Reprocessor parts (Controller, Collector, Waste Injector, Fluid Injector, Output Port, Power Port). The Waste Inject goes in the top face, the Collector on the bottom face. The other ones can go on any vertical face.\n\nThe Reprocessor recipes use an item and a fluid to craft another item. Mods and modpacks authors can add they own recipes in the usal ways. The Reprocessor need 1000 FE to process a single recipe. You can check the available recipes in JEI.\n\n\n**1.16.x / 1.17.x\n\n- In-game documentation is available with the The Extreme Book! (you need Patchouli too)\n\n- The Reactor and Turbine comes in two initial variants: Basic and Reinforced\n\nThe Basic variant is your early game choice: cheap and small (5x5x5 max for the Reactor, 5x5x10 for the Turbine)\n\nThe Reinforced variant if your heavy duty one: machines as big as you want (check your server config file) and build from steel ingots (or a botload of iron if your pack lack steel)\n\n- The internal buffers (energy / fluids) size of any Reactors and Turbines is a function of the machine size.\n\n- There are now two general tipes of Power Taps and Fluid Ports: active and passive\n\n - an Active one will send out power or fluids (or retrive them) automatically to the block connected to it\n\n - a Passive one will send out power or fluids (or accept them) ony if the block connected to it request it\n\n - using both types allow you to fine tune your energy or fluids distribution network\n\n- The Access Port has gone Solid ... the old girl is not as good as it was in the past at converting fuel ingots to liquid fuel. But it's still does a good jot at it\n\n- The Fuel Rod rendesing is even more FPS friendlier than before. You should have not rendering performance problems even with a huge number of Fuel Rods in your Reactors\n\n- Reactor / Turbine Forge Energy Charging Port. Use it to charge items that use energy (FE) to operate. Open the GUI and put the item in the input slot in the center (more info in the book).\n\n- Turbine Rotor can be build with any combinatios of blades you want (provided that their variant match the Turbine's and, well, it is a valid rotor :)) and will be animated using the shape you build\n\n- New fancy and FPS friendly GUI because i like fancy stuff and you like your FPSs\n\n- The Reinforced Computer Port support CC-Tweaked LUA program to help you manage your Reactors and Turbines\n\n- Modpack authors can use the Creative Water Generator / Steam Generator to create self sustaining Turbines setups or as a rare loot for their players\n\n- Ore-regen: the mod can re-generate it's ores by setting the \"enableWorldRegeneration\" config option to true. \n\nWorldgen must be enabled too, and so does the specific ore options you want to re-generate. If you need to re-generate chunks again, increate the value of the config option \"userWorldGenVersion\"\n\n\n## ABOUT A JEI PLUGIN\n\nAs you may have noticed, ER do not come with a JEI plugin that list all the moderators, fuels, coils, etc and their properties. The reason is simple: I don't want to have one. It would be no fun having the answer to \"what's work best\" outside the game, instead have fun and experiment!\n\nSince there are tons of blocks and items in any modern pack, in 2.0.6 I've added a tooltip to items and blocks that could be used as fuel or moderators for the Reactors or Turbine coils. It's an advanced tooltip so you need to enable them to spoil your fun :) There is also a client config option to disable them if needed\n\nI'm planning to have an in-game method to test your Reactor designs without having to build a whole one. The key code is already in place and Reactors and Turbines can already run in simulation mod\n\nAlso, to my fellow modders: please DO NOT add an external JEI plugin that show fuels, moderators, etc, for my mod, thank you.\n\n\n## MODPACKS AND LET'S PLAYs AND OTHER PERMISSIONS\n\nYou can add Extreme Reactors 2 (and Zero Core 2) to your mod pack or use them in your let's play / live streams to your heart content, no need to ask for my permission: you got it.\n\nIf you like, post a comment here or on the main forum thread to let's us know what fun stuff you are doing with the mods so we can all share in the fun. \n \nNo one is authorized to repost my mods, or any part of them, on any other website other then Curse Forge. If you wish, you can link to this page (or the Zero Core 2 one) from your website to let your users download the mod.\n\n\n## A NOTE ON SAFETY\n\nWe release our mods only on CurseForge, Modrinth or the FTB launcher and their respective websites:\n\nIf you found our mods on another website be sure that they do not come from us and we cannot guarantee that you are downloading something safe to use and that will work on your version of Minecraft. To keep things short: do not download those files and always use the CurseForge, Modrinth or the FTB launcher or their respective websites\n\n","published":"2022-11-18T17:48:49.314155Z","updated":"2023-10-15T15:17:27.715781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":69530,"followers":51,"categories":["technology","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["HnaPALbm","29cP26iq","q6eZgnW3","lXY8AQnu","qb93c55m","O76WSn3r","yk4Vc39G","2WVMMW6H","NfRN5BFW","xHyu5PeP","YAUrhKii","X49ifA8H","q1zYEzRt","NB4zEHJK","WYlgL8NK","qSp5oA64","xWhrtnGG","GEXjCRxl","rnzB7p2Y","lpEA1SCq","H8hwL9KY","OFI6WnhE","WjWzQcbH","tQHXTlmS","162lYZcb","JZOQJiht","ZaHjUOrO","1L7HJQWM","aWj4vg3e","lzg72TTO","xwLWlGec","lu5PWrmf","5CYl80HP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/idkvShUy/48547286b3acecb37d1fe7e2befaa631c65f29af.png"},"version":{"id":"5CYl80HP","project_id":"idkvShUy","author_id":"aPljNITF","featured":true,"name":"1.20.1-2.0.75","version_number":"1.20.1-2.0.75","changelog":"- Fixed in-game book recipe\n- Bumped version to 2.0.75","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-15T15:17:29.271842Z","downloads":15213,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6692cae13b74b27ccbb28f4ad792d2d87b5bf3a6c168d7a2f5d5e43aea9069fa7a5fa71b69346dc849986825883962f95460220b7fc1bc2fe468180520fe2ed8","sha1":"9ffe1bcb6174aa6f57e799d7865b9afa08453606"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/idkvShUy/versions/5CYl80HP/ExtremeReactors2-1.20.1-2.0.75.jar","filename":"ExtremeReactors2-1.20.1-2.0.75.jar","primary":true,"size":2338372,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"kR2IVnv0","project_id":"rHpb85Mf","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gp0ELhxH","user":{"id":"aPljNITF","username":"ZeroNoRyouki","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7107662?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-18T16:37:13.031737Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ExtremeReactors2-1.20.1-2.0.75.jar"},"mods\\Searchables-forge-1.20.1-1.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"185617d6d446f3d4ef6c7d5c6ee4e2fb731a89f7495157313b21292ec6b8e3dbcc10c0379ab49ecb2d0c64d0a78df74750d7f7336d5e6c43516a7c92f278c0a2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fuuu3xnx","slug":"searchables","project_type":"mod","team":"EScvpM9Q","title":"Searchables","description":"Searchables is a library mod that adds helper methods that allow for searching and filtering elements based on components, as well as offering built in auto-complete functionality.","body":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img src=\"https://i.blamejared.com/searchables.png\" alt=\"small_logo\" width=\"12.5%\"></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-right:1rem\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img src=\"https://i.blamejared.com/searchables_banner.png\" width=\"60%\"></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-right:1rem\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08/searchables/issues\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/jaredlll08/searchables?style=flat-square\" alt=\"Github Issues\" width=\"98\" height=\"20\"></a><a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08/searchables/blob/1.19.4/LICENSE\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/license/jaredlll08/searchables?color=3da6e4&style=flat-square\" alt=\"License \" width=\"78\" height=\"20\"></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Searchables is a library mod that adds helper methods that allow for searching and filtering elements based on components (</span>shape:square color:red<span style=\"font-size:14px\">), as well as offering built in auto-complete functionality.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The auto-complete looks like this:</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://i.blamejared.com/searchables_autocomplete.gif\" alt=\"searchables autocomplete\" width=\"813\" height=\"406\"></span></p>\n\n<p>This mod does nothing on it's own, but is used by other mods to improve the search experience.</p>\n\nIf you would like to support me in my modding endeavors, you can become a patron via **[![Patreon logo](https://i.imgur.com/CAJuExT.png) Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jaredlll08)**.\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/jared.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/jared)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

use**\n1. Drop the pack into your resource packs folder or Drag and Drop it in the Resource pack Selection\n2.

all surfaces and be physically connected to any solid block no matter the shape.\n- By shift-clicking on a Label with an item you'll be able to change its image, showing that item you selected.\n- Clicking on a Label will let the player interact with the block behind, making it perfect for your storage systems.\n- Images shown by Labels are pixelated and colored to better fit Minecraft style.

The purpose of the mod is to make interaction with resources look like a terminal.

Logo](https://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/16671459-lsrenderpearl.png)\n\nRenderPearl is an incredibly lightweight shader pack using the latest [Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/) and [GLSL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OpenGL_Shading_Language) features, aiming to deliver great performance with decently realistic graphics. This can be useful for PvP and other scenarios where performance is important\n\nIt is currently **only** tested on a Windows/NVIDIA PC. If you find a bug and want to report it (or give feedback/suggestions), the easiest way to do so is by leaving a comment on the [PMC page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/luracasmus-s-shaders/)\n\n> The name is based on [RenderDragon](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/RenderDragon)\n\n## Performance\n\nThe pack uses several tricks to improve performance in different scenarios, which can lead to FPS being significantly higher in some situations:\n\n* Shadows are automatically disabled when the contrast between sunlight and ambient light is too low, such as at night or during thunderstorms\n* Surfaces that are facing away from the sun never get shadows, which means that looking towards the sun improves performance significantly **(Since version 1.7 this only applies when Translucent Shadows are disabled)**\n* Shadows are completely disabled in The Nether\n\n## Customization\n\nAlmost everything is customizable and can be toggled, including:\n\n* Gamma, Color and Saturation\n* [Tonemap Operators](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tone_mapping)\n* Shadows\n  * Softness, Resolution, Color, Distance, etc.\n* Volumetric Light\n* Sun/moon and Sunlight Brightness\n* Ambient Light\n* Different types of Fog\n* [Ambient Occlusion](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ambient_occlusion)\n* Emissive Redstone, Lapis and Emerald Blocks as well as Flowers and Fungi\n* [FXAA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing)\n* Sharpening\n* Automatic Exposure\n* Bloom\n\nThe pack also allows for some further customization in these files within the pack itself:\n\n* `block.properties`\n* `item.properties`\n\n## How to Install\n\nThe pack requires **[GLSL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OpenGL_Shading_Language) 4.60** / **[OpenGL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OpenGL) 4.6** support (might require updating graphics drivers) as well as **[Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/) 1.7.0 or later**\n\nDownload the ZIP file\n\nDownload and install the latest [Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)\n\nMove the ZIP file into your Shader Packs folder (usually `%AppData%\\.minecraft\\shaderpacks`)\n\nSelect the pack in the Shader Packs menu and choose the appropriate settings profile for your

alt=\"Sodium 0.4 Comparison\"></img>\n <p>\n   <!-- This paragraph is load bearing, and ensures a margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\n---\n\n### ☕ A brief message...\n\n**This mod is the result of thousands of hours of development, and is made possible thanks to players like you.** If you would like to show a token of your appreciation for our work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying us a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n---\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks.

This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.

They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains both \"Core\" and \"Foundation\" - a collection of common components, resources, and tools.\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config` - contains client-specific options.\n- _Common_: `thermal-common.toml` file located in `/config` - contains worldgen options.\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-expansion) - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

A server-friendly and content-rich blend of magic and technology!\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.\n\nThe Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.\n\nAs a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.\n\nThis module contains \"Expansion\" - the original mod in the series, going all the way back to Minecraft 1.2.5. It contains the \"industrial base\" of the Series, providing options for energy generation, storage, and resource processing!\n\nThe mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.\n\n### __Configuration__\n\n- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`\n- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.\n\nCopying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.\n\nDedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`\n\n## __Features__\n\nThis section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.\n\nWIP - Thanks for your patience.\n\n![Thermal Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png \"Thermal Series\") \n\n### __The other modules are here:__\n\n- __[Thermal Foundation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-foundation) - Basics and Resources__\n- __[Thermal Cultivation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-cultivation) - Farming and Foods__\n- __[Thermal Dynamics - Not Yet Updated to 1.16](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-dynamics) - Logistics and Transport__\n- __[Thermal Innovation](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-innovation) - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets__\n- __[Thermal Integration](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-integration) - Modded Compatibility Enhancements__\n- __[Thermal Locomotion](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermal-locomotion) - Rails and Minecarts__\n\n__This mod series requires CoFH Core.

usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-04-27T08:57:19.481764Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":4211898,"followers":4889,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":324627,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c","sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\Nullscape_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar":{"sha512":"c6012c383432e8ccdac42ed76c13461802e2687657b0a037daa56b81f2e1542ea976451caaffa421f88efb3e3a53d955845f7f0ae54e8826fcaedac9b08005d6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LPjGiSO4","slug":"nullscape","project_type":"mod","team":"oJIBNZ9Y","title":"Nullscape","description":"Nullscape keeps the End as a barren, depressing, and bleak place: as it should be, and always will be.","body":"\n# Nullscape\n[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Stardust-Labs-MC/Nullscape?color=blueviolet&logo=github \"View latest release\")](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/Nullscape/releases) [![Discord Badge](https://img.shields.io/discord/738046951236567162?color=blue&logo=discord \"Join our Discord Server\")](https://discord.gg/stardustlabs) [![Modrinth Badge](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/nullscape?label=Modrinth&logo=modrinth \"View our Modrinth page\")](https://modrinth.com/mod/nullscape) [![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Stardust_Labs-green \"View the Stardust Labs License\")](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/license) [![Wiki Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/wiki-Miraheze-yellow \"View our Wiki\")](https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/) [![Issues Badge](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Stardust-Labs-MC/Nullscape?color=orange&logo=github \"View or open an issue\")](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/Nullscape/issues) [![Weblate Badge](https://img.shields.io/weblate/progress/stardust-labs?server=https%3A%2F%2Fweblate.catter.dev&logo=weblate \"Translate here\")](https://weblate.catter.dev/projects/stardust-labs)\n\nNullscape keeps the End as a barren, depressing, and bleak place: as it should be, and always will be.\n![Nullscape Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224808975-6d3866c1-a968-4fa1-a1c1-6d9318e42ed9.png)\n## Notes\n- Nullscape is **not** compatible with the majority of end worldgen projects; except Better End\n- Do not add this to an existing end - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\nNullscape will make you feel tiny and alone in the vast expanse of the End. You against the void - nothing more than that.\nNullscape boosts the End's height to 384 blocks, and makes full use of 1.18's modern features to generate incredibly varied terrain. You'll find everything from shattered islands, to floating valleys, to crystallized peaks! Different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and feelings to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.\n__ __\n[![Patron

Downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/fallingtree?logo=Modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingtree)\n\nThis mod will change the way you break trees. 4 modes are available:\n* Instantaneous: Break one log and the whole tree will fall\n* Shift down: Break a block and the log will slowly shift down as you cut it (good if you don't want to \"cheat\" too much but are lazy to go cut top log blocks 😛)\n* Fall items: Break one log and the whole tree will fall with an animation\n* Fall blocks: Break one log and the whole tree will fall on the floor with an animation\n\n![Demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo.gif)\n![Another demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo2.gif)\n\nSeveral options are available in the config file:\n\n* Customize what is considered as a tree (log blocks & leave blocks).\n* Customize what tools can be used (add more axes, allow everything, ...).\n* Turn leaf breaking on/off.\n* Option to disable the effect of the mod by sneaking (can be reversed).\n* Change speed depending on the tree size.\n* Damage tools or not (can set it to break the tool by the amount of blocks there were in the tree).\n* Let tools at 1 durability if it's going to break.\n\nCheck out the [wiki](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/wiki) for some more information.\n\n---\n\n* For Fabric users, **Fabric API** is required.\n* For Forge users, **Cloth Config API** is optional on the client and allows you to have a config GUI in game.\n\nNOTE: On servers this mod can be server-side only, client isn't required (except if you use the change speed feature and/or enchants configurations).","published":"2021-01-11T19:27:26.315086Z","updated":"2024-04-29T13:14:28.303180Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":934288,"followers":1146,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w39a","21w43a","1.18-pre2","1.18","1.18.1","22w05a","22w06a","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2","22w13a","22w14a","22w17a","22w19a","1.19-pre5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w40a","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["ClS5aGDu","by7f3jqu","wYPHBZnq","IvWeyNRf","ecFvHSSj","hYRTlWck","KA0lsBqm","frFjp7XE","Oy2HfoQu","HhiMtvaB","MBqZmh7k","rolL2W5j","VBOnAt36","fy6OOm9Q","PjU0ylA8","IjfKe2LK","BjxlB5ad","nDc9P6UR","T0QtOBLV","VlJQWF9M","4FktLQ41","QtHstonj","m2oM2Xzb","YBlmxpFC","Bhm08p1U","vT2GkHlJ","PCbggfQI","8h9olfhO","XpnXvmmg","1HEbx8wR","O7EzwYaR","k08wKfdA","K2xDwQMA","jHljfMeN","izrF4sw0","pM721YNG","48Uga7jj","RhvVV7aI","Wll71SI1","wm1VgWAh","Ge9TTua8","LI0g8wDL","UiUNxrl7","XzUcHIz2","MNaOu00H","EcPbQcBT","I4HjcOo5","hnXlvYfp","Brv0vjTc","GMOPXKvF","CaTPjokz","aMFJxIHm","qtfvfhdv","GS7o9NMO","1u6nezii","djHFleaq","Fn9hSpZQ","2qvQxa1B","ivSkiG78","TuLQv2oz","cvdeCtGH","8GR9mmKD","zv2J7DYl","1nneGSqI","mKpQdYKO","8XmHwXLO","LoJuqMMZ","9K3tdqQy","YMLyKqOj","k2geZqGH","3sdO7qgf","YlfhOTW2","iAX7H9LQ","LTbIi2M1","kgBh4dSx","bQrEMzOP","KRs7tr5H","dj8wmIBS","PgS4RtQX","Rcuv9i9M","9kSv8gsK","5DSiBB1r","qrxLiOcL","E4f85gRR","TIoBK1U1","2TNwaTtm","cMkbt0f5","NveCqCkX","BQ6i1U5X","rK4GkUX6","59SG26Fv","1TSCSQ4C","iszfrsgL","P55fppyL","XrkGy9Ky","reXqEJgT","yRWIgpnS","66mp0b9v","oXRivlMX","6KJqXkV0","frsJrlLk","kPSbFSaC","8q3U34GC","SQSRyVeT","BJ2K7C0J","NAMMnpkI","HojA8R8T","BdqBwLsv","NF3wLCFV","KW9Dm2r0","7vuduZD7","tOzqGtqB","7PRbBpzE","KRt1RhNH","akjkv5e2","Ua1F3TBl","H9oeRV3c","t9r6pZcy","snIN7mL9","Fi75hN4R","yr3p0Npt","HnH1cLYq","2u9Dpwhc","Gkt6UcDh","NrtzFkZE","BaMypQ7l","nZoL7IuF","mb15RrXi","2yoOOkuy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Fb4jn8m6/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"NrtzFkZE","project_id":"Fb4jn8m6","author_id":"fYPSlcba","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-4.3.4","version_number":"1.20.1-4.3.4","changelog":"[Changelog
